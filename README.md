# APPS dataset refined by SAL
APPS is a python coding competition dataset.
The original contents can be found in [here](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps).

## Refined
We (SAL, Software Analysis Laboratory) refined the original dataset.
All the modified data have `README.txt` in directory.
The major modifications are as follows:
