You have an integer $n$. Let's define following tree generation as McDic's generation:  Make a complete and full binary tree of $2^{n} - 1$ vertices. Complete and full binary tree means a tree that exactly one vertex is a root, all leaves have the same depth (distance from the root), and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two child nodes.  Select a non-root vertex $v$ from that binary tree.  Remove $v$ from tree and make new edges between $v$'s parent and $v$'s direct children. If $v$ has no children, then no new edges will be made. 

You have a tree. Determine if this tree can be made by McDic's generation. If yes, then find the parent vertex of removed vertex in tree.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 17$).

The $i$-th of the next $2^{n} - 3$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \le a_{i} \lt b_{i} \le 2^{n} - 2$) — meaning there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.


-----Output-----

Print two lines.

In the first line, print a single integer — the number of answers. If given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then print $0$.

In the second line, print all possible answers in ascending order, separated by spaces. If the given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then don't print anything.

-----Note-----

In the first example, $3$ is the only possible answer. $8$ 

In the second example, there are $2$ possible answers. [Image] 

In the third example, the tree can't be generated by McDic's generation.
