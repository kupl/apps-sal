Ehab is interested in the bitwise-xor operation and the special graphs. Mahmoud gave him a problem that combines both. He has a complete graph consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1. For all 0 ≤ u < v < n, vertex u and vertex v are connected with an undirected edge that has weight $u \oplus v$ (where $\oplus$ is the bitwise-xor operation). Can you find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of that graph?

You can read about complete graphs in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph

You can read about the minimum spanning tree in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree

The weight of the minimum spanning tree is the sum of the weights on the edges included in it.


-----Input-----

The only line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^12), the number of vertices in the graph.


-----Output-----

The only line contains an integer x, the weight of the graph's minimum spanning tree.


-----Example-----
Input
4

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first sample: [Image] The weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1+2+1=4.
