$Riggi$   is a spy of $KBI$ and he is on a secret mission, he is spying an Underworld Don  $Anit$.
$Riggi$  is spying him since 5 years and he is not able to find  any evidence against $Anit$. 
$KBI$ told $Riggi$ they will send him a code string in a special format that will inform him whether he  has continue or return back from mission.
According to $KBI$  firstly  he  has to find what is the original string and then he has to check string is palindrome or not .
If its a palindrome then he has to leave the mission and return back else continue spying $Anit$. 
Rules to find original string :
1:-If in Code string any integer(N) followed by a string of alphabets that starts with '+' and  ends with '-' then he has to repeat that string N times  , like 3+acg- = acgacgacg.
2:-If there is no integer present before string then print the string is repeated 1 time.
like bc=bc.
Example of conversion from  Code string  to original string  : 2+ac-3+kb-j=acackbkbkbj  

-----Input:-----
- Code string $S$ is taken as input  .

-----Output:-----
- Print  string $Continue$ if code string $S$ is not a palindrome else print $Return$ .

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq S \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$

-----Sample Input 1:-----
3+xy-bb3+yx-

-----Sample Output 1:-----
Return

-----Sample Input 2:-----
3+xy-bb3+xy-

-----Sample Output 2:-----
Continue

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Sample 1:- original string will be xyxyxybbyxyxyx which is  a palindrome hence print $Return$.
Sample 2:- original string will be xyxyxybbxyxyxy which is not a palindrome hence print 
$Continue$.
