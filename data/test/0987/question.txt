You are given a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n and m pairs of positions (a_{j}, b_{j}).

At each step you can choose a pair from the given positions and swap the numbers in that positions. What is the lexicographically maximal permutation one can get?

Let p and q be two permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n. p is lexicographically smaller than the q if a number 1 ≤ i ≤ n exists, so p_{k} = q_{k} for 1 ≤ k < i and p_{i} < q_{i}.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6) — the length of the permutation p and the number of pairs of positions.

The second line contains n distinct integers p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the elements of the permutation p.

Each of the last m lines contains two integers (a_{j}, b_{j}) (1 ≤ a_{j}, b_{j} ≤ n) — the pairs of positions to swap. Note that you are given a positions, not the values to swap.


-----Output-----

Print the only line with n distinct integers p'_{i} (1 ≤ p'_{i} ≤ n) — the lexicographically maximal permutation one can get.
