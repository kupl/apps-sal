User ainta has a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. As the New Year is coming, he wants to make his permutation as pretty as possible.

Permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is prettier than permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, if and only if there exists an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) where a_1 = b_1, a_2 = b_2, ..., a_{k} - 1 = b_{k} - 1 and a_{k} < b_{k} all holds.

As known, permutation p is so sensitive that it could be only modified by swapping two distinct elements. But swapping two elements is harder than you think. Given an n × n binary matrix A, user ainta can swap the values of p_{i} and p_{j} (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) if and only if A_{i}, j = 1.

Given the permutation p and the matrix A, user ainta wants to know the prettiest permutation that he can obtain.


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the size of the permutation p.

The second line contains n space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} — the permutation p that user ainta has. Each integer between 1 and n occurs exactly once in the given permutation.

Next n lines describe the matrix A. The i-th line contains n characters '0' or '1' and describes the i-th row of A. The j-th character of the i-th line A_{i}, j is the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of A. It is guaranteed that, for all integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, A_{i}, j = A_{j}, i holds. Also, for all integers i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, A_{i}, i = 0 holds.


-----Output-----

In the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, describing the prettiest permutation that can be obtained.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the swap needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is: (p_1, p_7).

In the second sample, the swaps needed to obtain the prettiest permutation is (p_1, p_3), (p_4, p_5), (p_3, p_4).  [Image] 

A permutation p is a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. The i-th element of the permutation p is denoted as p_{i}. The size of the permutation p is denoted as n.
