The subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You are given an integer $n$. 

You have to find a sequence $s$ consisting of digits $\{1, 3, 7\}$ such that it has exactly $n$ subsequences equal to $1337$.

For example, sequence $337133377$ has $6$ subsequences equal to $1337$:   $337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}7\underline{7}$ (you can remove the second and fifth characters);  $337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}7\underline{7}$ (you can remove the third and fifth characters);  $337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}37\underline{7}$ (you can remove the fourth and fifth characters);  $337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}\underline{7}7$ (you can remove the second and sixth characters);  $337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}\underline{7}7$ (you can remove the third and sixth characters);  $337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}3\underline{7}7$ (you can remove the fourth and sixth characters). 

Note that the length of the sequence $s$ must not exceed $10^5$.

You have to answer $t$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10$) â€” the number of queries. 

Next $t$ lines contains a description of queries: the $i$-th line contains one integer $n_i$ ($1 \le n_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For the $i$-th query print one string $s_i$ ($1 \le |s_i| \le 10^5$) consisting of digits $\{1, 3, 7\}$. String $s_i$ must have exactly $n_i$ subsequences $1337$. If there are multiple such strings, print any of them.
