In the second hour, another 10 liters of soup is made. Since it is a bit warmer than the hour before, the first bowl gets empty while the second bowl shrinks to 3. At the end of the second hour, only one bowl with 3 liters soup is left. In the third hour, another bowl with less volume of soup is made, but as the temperature dropped too, both bowls survive till the end of the hour."]]}
