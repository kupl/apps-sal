Snuke, who loves animals, built a zoo.
There are N animals in this zoo. They are conveniently numbered 1 through N, and arranged in a circle.
The animal numbered i (2≤i≤N-1) is adjacent to the animals numbered i-1 and i+1. Also, the animal numbered 1 is adjacent to the animals numbered 2 and N, and the animal numbered N is adjacent to the animals numbered N-1 and 1.
There are two kinds of animals in this zoo: honest sheep that only speak the truth, and lying wolves that only tell lies.
Snuke cannot tell the difference between these two species, and asked each animal the following question: "Are your neighbors of the same species?" The animal numbered i answered s_i. Here, if s_i is o, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of the same species, and if s_i is x, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of different species.
More formally, a sheep answered o if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered x otherwise.
Similarly, a wolf answered x if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered o otherwise.
Snuke is wondering whether there is a valid assignment of species to the animals that is consistent with these responses. If there is such an assignment, show one such assignment. Otherwise, print -1.

-----Constraints-----
 - 3 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
 - s is a string of length N consisting of o and x.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
s

-----Output-----
If there does not exist an valid assignment that is consistent with s, print -1.
Otherwise, print an string t in the following format. The output is considered correct if the assignment described by t is consistent with s.
 - t is a string of length N consisting of S and W.
 - If t_i is S, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a sheep. If t_i is W, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a wolf.

-----Sample Input-----
6
ooxoox

-----Sample Output-----
SSSWWS

For example, if the animals numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are respectively a sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, wolf, and sheep, it is consistent with their responses. Besides, there is another valid assignment of species: a wolf, sheep, wolf, sheep, wolf and wolf.
Let us remind you: if the neiboring animals are of the same species, a sheep answers o and a wolf answers x. If the neiboring animals are of different species, a sheep answers x and a wolf answers o.
