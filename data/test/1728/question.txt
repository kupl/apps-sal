You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, the root is the vertex number 1.

Each vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex v by c_{v}. Initially c_{v} = 0.

You have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex v and a color x, and then color all vectices in the subtree of v (including v itself) in color x. In other words, for every vertex u, such that the path from root to u passes through v, set c_{u} = x.

It is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from 0.

You can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory).


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n - 1 integers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} < i), where p_{i} means that there is an edge between vertices i and p_{i}.

The third line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n), where c_{i} is the color you should color the i-th vertex into.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. 


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.
