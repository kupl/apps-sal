You are given an array a. Some element of this array a_{i} is a local minimum iff it is strictly less than both of its neighbours (that is, a_{i} < a_{i} - 1 and a_{i} < a_{i} + 1). Also the element can be called local maximum iff it is strictly greater than its neighbours (that is, a_{i} > a_{i} - 1 and a_{i} > a_{i} + 1). Since a_1 and a_{n} have only one neighbour each, they are neither local minima nor local maxima.

An element is called a local extremum iff it is either local maximum or local minimum. Your task is to calculate the number of local extrema in the given array.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — the elements of array a.


-----Output-----

Print the number of local extrema in the given array.
