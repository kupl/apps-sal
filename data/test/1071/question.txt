Bizon the Champion is called the Champion for a reason. 

Bizon the Champion has recently got a present — a new glass cupboard with n shelves and he decided to put all his presents there. All the presents can be divided into two types: medals and cups. Bizon the Champion has a_1 first prize cups, a_2 second prize cups and a_3 third prize cups. Besides, he has b_1 first prize medals, b_2 second prize medals and b_3 third prize medals. 

Naturally, the rewards in the cupboard must look good, that's why Bizon the Champion decided to follow the rules:  any shelf cannot contain both cups and medals at the same time;  no shelf can contain more than five cups;  no shelf can have more than ten medals. 

Help Bizon the Champion find out if we can put all the rewards so that all the conditions are fulfilled.
