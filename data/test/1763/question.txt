You have to restore the wall. The wall consists of $N$ pillars of bricks, the height of the $i$-th pillar is initially equal to $h_{i}$, the height is measured in number of bricks. After the restoration all the $N$ pillars should have equal heights.

You are allowed the following operations: put a brick on top of one pillar, the cost of this operation is $A$; remove a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar, the cost of this operation is $R$; move a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar to the top of another pillar, the cost of this operation is $M$.

You cannot create additional pillars or ignore some of pre-existing pillars even if their height becomes $0$.

What is the minimal total cost of restoration, in other words, what is the minimal total cost to make all the pillars of equal height?


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains four integers $N$, $A$, $R$, $M$ ($1 \le N \le 10^{5}$, $0 \le A, R, M \le 10^{4}$) — the number of pillars and the costs of operations.

The second line contains $N$ integers $h_{i}$ ($0 \le h_{i} \le 10^{9}$) — initial heights of pillars.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal cost of restoration.
