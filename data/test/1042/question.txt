Count the number of distinct sequences a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i}) consisting of positive integers such that gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) = x and $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i} = y$. As this number could be large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

gcd here means the greatest common divisor.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two positive integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the number of such sequences modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 9

Output
3

Input
5 8

Output
0



-----Note-----

There are three suitable sequences in the first test: (3, 3, 3), (3, 6), (6, 3).

There are no suitable sequences in the second test.
