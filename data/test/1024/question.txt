You are given a permutation of integers from 1 to n. Exactly once you apply the following operation to this permutation: pick a random segment and shuffle its elements. Formally:  Pick a random segment (continuous subsequence) from l to r. All $\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$ segments are equiprobable.  Let k = r - l + 1, i.e. the length of the chosen segment. Pick a random permutation of integers from 1 to k, p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k}. All k! permutation are equiprobable.  This permutation is applied to elements of the chosen segment, i.e. permutation a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l} - 1, a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r} - 1, a_{r}, a_{r} + 1, ..., a_{n} is transformed to a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l} - 1, a_{l} - 1 + p_1, a_{l} - 1 + p_2, ..., a_{l} - 1 + p_{k} - 1, a_{l} - 1 + p_{k}, a_{r} + 1, ..., a_{n}. 

Inversion if a pair of elements (not necessary neighbouring) with the wrong relative order. In other words, the number of inversion is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a_{i} > a_{j}. Find the expected number of inversions after we apply exactly one operation mentioned above.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the permutation.

The second line contains n distinct integers from 1 to n — elements of the permutation.


-----Output-----

Print one real value — the expected number of inversions. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-9}$.
