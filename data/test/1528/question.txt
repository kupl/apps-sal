In some other world, today is Christmas.
Mr. Takaha decides to make a multi-dimensional burger in his party. A level-L burger (L is an integer greater than or equal to 0) is the following thing:
 - A level-0 burger is a patty.
 - A level-L burger (L \geq 1) is a bun, a level-(L-1) burger, a patty, another level-(L-1) burger and another bun, stacked vertically in this order from the bottom.
For example, a level-1 burger and a level-2 burger look like BPPPB and BBPPPBPBPPPBB (rotated 90 degrees), where B and P stands for a bun and a patty.
The burger Mr. Takaha will make is a level-N burger. Lunlun the Dachshund will eat X layers from the bottom of this burger (a layer is a patty or a bun). How many patties will she eat?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 50
 - 1 \leq X \leq ( the total number of layers in a level-N burger )
 - N and X are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X

-----Output-----
Print the number of patties in the bottom-most X layers from the bottom of a level-N burger.

-----Sample Input-----
2 7

-----Sample Output-----
4

There are 4 patties in the bottom-most 7 layers of a level-2 burger (BBPPPBPBPPPBB).
