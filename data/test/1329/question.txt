You are given an integer N. Among the divisors of N! (= 1 \times 2 \times ... \times N), how many Shichi-Go numbers (literally "Seven-Five numbers") are there?
Here, a Shichi-Go number is a positive integer that has exactly 75 divisors.

-----Note-----
When a positive integer A divides a positive integer B, A is said to a divisor of B.
For example, 6 has four divisors: 1, 2, 3 and 6.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - N is an integer.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

-----Output-----
Print the number of the Shichi-Go numbers that are divisors of N!.

-----Sample Input-----
9

-----Sample Output-----
0

There are no Shichi-Go numbers among the divisors of 9! = 1 \times 2 \times ... \times 9 = 362880.
