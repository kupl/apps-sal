As a token of his gratitude, Takahashi has decided to give his mother an integer sequence.
The sequence A needs to satisfy the conditions below:
 - A consists of integers between X and Y (inclusive).
 - For each 1\leq i \leq |A|-1, A_{i+1} is a multiple of A_i and strictly greater than A_i.
Find the maximum possible length of the sequence.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq X \leq Y \leq 10^{18}
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible length of the sequence.

-----Sample Input-----
3 20

-----Sample Output-----
3

The sequence 3,6,18 satisfies the conditions.
