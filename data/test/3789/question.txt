We have N gemstones labeled 1 through N.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).
 - Select a positive integer x, and smash all the gems labeled with multiples of x.
Then, for each i, if the gem labeled i remains without getting smashed, you will receive a_i yen (the currency of Japan).
However, a_i may be negative, in which case you will be charged money.
By optimally performing the operation, how much yen can you earn?

-----Constraints-----
 - All input values are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - |a_i| \leq 10^9

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

-----Sample Input-----
6
1 2 -6 4 5 3

-----Sample Output-----
12

It is optimal to smash Gem 3 and 6.
