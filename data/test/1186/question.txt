Given an integer N, find two permutations:  Permutation p of numbers from 1 to N such that p_{i} ≠ i and p_{i} & i = 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., N.  Permutation q of numbers from 1 to N such that q_{i} ≠ i and q_{i} & i ≠ 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., N. 

& is the bitwise AND operation.


-----Input-----

The input consists of one line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5).


-----Output-----

For each subtask, if the required permutation doesn't exist, output a single line containing the word "NO"; otherwise output the word "YES" in the first line and N elements of the permutation, separated by spaces, in the second line. If there are several possible permutations in a subtask, output any of them.
