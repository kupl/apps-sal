We have a grid with H rows and W columns of squares.
Snuke is painting these squares in colors 1, 2, ..., N.
Here, the following conditions should be satisfied:
 - For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), there are exactly a_i squares painted in Color i. Here, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = H W.
 - For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the squares painted in Color i are 4-connected. That is, every square painted in Color i can be reached from every square painted in Color i by repeatedly traveling to a horizontally or vertically adjacent square painted in Color i.
Find a way to paint the squares so that the conditions are satisfied.
It can be shown that a solution always exists.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 100
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ H W
 - a_i ≥ 1
 - a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N = H W

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print one way to paint the squares that satisfies the conditions.
Output in the following format:
c_{1 1} ... c_{1 W}
:
c_{H 1} ... c_{H W}

Here, c_{i j} is the color of the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.

-----Sample Input-----
2 2
3
2 1 1

-----Sample Output-----
1 1
2 3

Below is an example of an invalid solution:
1 2
3 1

This is because the squares painted in Color 1 are not 4-connected.
