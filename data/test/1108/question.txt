George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool Programmers). George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory. 

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has n rooms in total. At the moment the i-th room has p_{i} people living in it and the room can accommodate q_{i} people in total (p_{i} ≤ q_{i}). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of rooms.

The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers p_{i} and q_{i} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ q_{i} ≤ 100) — the number of people who already live in the i-th room and the room's capacity.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of rooms where George and Alex can move in.
