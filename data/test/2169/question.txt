We have a grid with H rows and W columns. The square at the i-th row and the j-th column will be called Square (i,j).
The integers from 1 through H×W are written throughout the grid, and the integer written in Square (i,j) is A_{i,j}.
You, a magical girl, can teleport a piece placed on Square (i,j) to Square (x,y) by consuming |x-i|+|y-j| magic points.
You now have to take Q practical tests of your ability as a magical girl.
The i-th test will be conducted as follows:
 - Initially, a piece is placed on the square where the integer L_i is written.
 - Let x be the integer written in the square occupied by the piece. Repeatedly move the piece to the square where the integer x+D is written, as long as x is not R_i. The test ends when x=R_i.
 - Here, it is guaranteed that R_i-L_i is a multiple of D.
For each test, find the sum of magic points consumed during that test.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq H,W \leq 300
 - 1 \leq D \leq H×W
 - 1 \leq A_{i,j} \leq H×W
 - A_{i,j} \neq A_{x,y} ((i,j) \neq (x,y))
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq H×W
 - (R_i-L_i) is a multiple of D.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W D
A_{1,1} A_{1,2} ... A_{1,W}
:
A_{H,1} A_{H,2} ... A_{H,W}
Q
L_1 R_1
:
L_Q R_Q

-----Output-----
For each test, print the sum of magic points consumed during that test.
Output should be in the order the tests are conducted.

-----Sample Input-----
3 3 2
1 4 3
2 5 7
8 9 6
1
4 8

-----Sample Output-----
5

 - 4 is written in Square (1,2).
 - 6 is written in Square (3,3).
 - 8 is written in Square (3,1).
Thus, the sum of magic points consumed during the first test is (|3-1|+|3-2|)+(|3-3|+|1-3|)=5.
