By the age of three Smart Beaver mastered all arithmetic operations and got this summer homework from the amazed teacher:

You are given a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Your task is to perform on it m consecutive operations of the following type:  For given numbers x_{i} and v_{i} assign value v_{i} to element a_{x}_{i}.  For given numbers l_{i} and r_{i} you've got to calculate sum $\sum_{x = 0}^{r_{i} - l_{i}}(f_{x} \cdot a_{l_{i} + x})$, where f_0 = f_1 = 1 and at i ≥ 2: f_{i} = f_{i} - 1 + f_{i} - 2.  For a group of three numbers l_{i} r_{i} d_{i} you should increase value a_{x} by d_{i} for all x (l_{i} ≤ x ≤ r_{i}). 

Smart Beaver planned a tour around great Canadian lakes, so he asked you to help him solve the given problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of integers in the sequence and the number of operations, correspondingly. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5). Then follow m lines, each describes an operation. Each line starts with an integer t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 3) — the operation type:   if t_{i} = 1, then next follow two integers x_{i} v_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 0 ≤ v_{i} ≤ 10^5);  if t_{i} = 2, then next follow two integers l_{i} r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n);  if t_{i} = 3, then next follow three integers l_{i} r_{i} d_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n, 0 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 10^5). 

The input limits for scoring 30 points are (subproblem E1):   It is guaranteed that n does not exceed 100, m does not exceed 10000 and there will be no queries of the 3-rd type. 

The input limits for scoring 70 points are (subproblems E1+E2):   It is guaranteed that there will be queries of the 1-st and 2-nd type only. 

The input limits for scoring 100 points are (subproblems E1+E2+E3):   No extra limitations. 


-----Output-----

For each query print the calculated sum modulo 1000000000 (10^9).
