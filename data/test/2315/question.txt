You are given a range of positive integers from $l$ to $r$.

Find such a pair of integers $(x, y)$ that $l \le x, y \le r$, $x \ne y$ and $x$ divides $y$.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

You are also asked to answer $T$ independent queries.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1000$) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 998244353$) — inclusive borders of the range.

It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries, which have at least one suitable pair.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ lines, each line should contain the answer — two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $l \le x, y \le r$, $x \ne y$ and $x$ divides $y$. The answer in the $i$-th line should correspond to the $i$-th query from the input.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
