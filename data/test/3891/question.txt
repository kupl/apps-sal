Consider a table of size $n \times m$, initially fully white. Rows are numbered $1$ through $n$ from top to bottom, columns $1$ through $m$ from left to right. Some square inside the table with odd side length was painted black. Find the center of this square.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 115$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the table.

The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains a string of $m$ characters $s_{i1} s_{i2} \ldots s_{im}$ ($s_{ij}$ is 'W' for white cells and 'B' for black cells), describing the $i$-th row of the table.


-----Output-----

Output two integers $r$ and $c$ ($1 \le r \le n$, $1 \le c \le m$) separated by a space — the row and column numbers of the center of the black square.
