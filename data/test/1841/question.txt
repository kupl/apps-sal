Sereja has an array a, consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. The boy cannot sit and do nothing, he decided to study an array. Sereja took a piece of paper and wrote out m integers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ n). For each number l_{i} he wants to know how many distinct numbers are staying on the positions l_{i}, l_{i} + 1, ..., n. Formally, he want to find the number of distinct numbers among a_{l}_{i}, a_{l}_{i} + 1, ..., a_{n}.?

Sereja wrote out the necessary array elements but the array was so large and the boy was so pressed for time. Help him, find the answer for the described question for each l_{i}.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5) — the array elements.

Next m lines contain integers l_1, l_2, ..., l_{m}. The i-th line contains integer l_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print m lines — on the i-th line print the answer to the number l_{i}.
