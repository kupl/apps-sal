Given is an integer sequence A_1, ..., A_N of length N.
We will choose exactly \left\lfloor \frac{N}{2} \right\rfloor elements from this sequence so that no two adjacent elements are chosen.
Find the maximum possible sum of the chosen elements.
Here \lfloor x \rfloor denotes the greatest integer not greater than x.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
 - |A_i|\leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible sum of the chosen elements.

-----Sample Input-----
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

-----Sample Output-----
12

Choosing 2, 4, and 6 makes the sum 12, which is the maximum possible value.
