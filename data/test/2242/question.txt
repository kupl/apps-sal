Given is a string S consisting of digits from 1 through 9.
Find the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|) that satisfy the following condition:
Condition: In base ten, the i-th through j-th characters of S form an integer that is a multiple of 2019.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200000
 - S is a string consisting of digits from 1 through 9.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|) that satisfy the condition.

-----Sample Input-----
1817181712114

-----Sample Output-----
3

Three pairs - (1,5), (5,9), and (9,13) - satisfy the condition.
