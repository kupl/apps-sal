Joisino the magical girl has decided to turn every single digit that exists on this world into 1.
Rewriting a digit i with j (0≤i,j≤9) costs c_{i,j} MP (Magic Points).
She is now standing before a wall. The wall is divided into HW squares in H rows and W columns, and at least one square contains a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
You are given A_{i,j} that describes the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left, as follows:
 - If A_{i,j}≠-1, the square contains a digit A_{i,j}.
 - If A_{i,j}=-1, the square does not contain a digit.
Find the minimum total amount of MP required to turn every digit on this wall into 1 in the end.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤H,W≤200
 - 1≤c_{i,j}≤10^3 (i≠j)
 - c_{i,j}=0 (i=j)
 - -1≤A_{i,j}≤9
 - All input values are integers.
 - There is at least one digit on the wall.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
c_{0,0} ... c_{0,9}
:
c_{9,0} ... c_{9,9}
A_{1,1} ... A_{1,W}
:
A_{H,1} ... A_{H,W}

-----Output-----
Print the minimum total amount of MP required to turn every digit on the wall into 1 in the end.

-----Sample Input-----

0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9

9 9 9 9 2 9 9 9 0 9
9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0
-1 -1 -1 -1
8 1 1 8

-----Sample Output-----
12

To turn a single 8 into 1, it is optimal to first turn 8 into 4, then turn 4 into 9, and finally turn 9 into 1, costing 6 MP.
The wall contains two 8s, so the minimum total MP required is 6×2=12.
