You are given a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ directed edges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are "abaca", then the value of that path is $3$. Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two positive integers $n, m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 300\,000$), denoting that the graph has $n$ nodes and $m$ directed edges.

The second line contains a string $s$ with only lowercase English letters. The $i$-th character is the letter assigned to the $i$-th node.

Then $m$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $x, y$ ($1 \leq x, y \leq n$), describing a directed edge from $x$ to $y$. Note that $x$ can be equal to $y$ and there can be multiple edges between $x$ and $y$. Also the graph can be not connected.


-----Output-----

Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the path with largest value is $1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$. The value is $3$ because the letter 'a' appears $3$ times.
