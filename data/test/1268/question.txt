Jafar has n cans of cola. Each can is described by two integers: remaining volume of cola a_{i} and can's capacity b_{i} (a_{i}  ≤  b_{i}).

Jafar has decided to pour all remaining cola into just 2 cans, determine if he can do this or not!


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — number of cola cans.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — volume of remaining cola in cans.

The third line contains n space-separated integers that b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (a_{i} ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^9) — capacities of the cans.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to pour all remaining cola in 2 cans. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
