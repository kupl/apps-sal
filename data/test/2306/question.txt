In the year 2168, AtCoder Inc., which is much larger than now, is starting a limited express train service called AtCoder Express.
In the plan developed by the president Takahashi, the trains will run as follows:
 - A train will run for (t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + ... + t_N) seconds.
 - In the first t_1 seconds, a train must run at a speed of at most v_1 m/s (meters per second). Similarly, in the subsequent t_2 seconds, a train must run at a speed of at most v_2 m/s, and so on.
According to the specifications of the trains, the acceleration of a train must be always within ±1m/s^2. Additionally, a train must stop at the beginning and the end of the run.
Find the maximum possible distance that a train can cover in the run.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 100
 - 1 \leq t_i \leq 200
 - 1 \leq v_i \leq 100
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
t_1 t_2 t_3 … t_N
v_1 v_2 v_3 … v_N

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible that a train can cover in the run.

Output is considered correct if its absolute difference from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}.

-----Sample Input-----
1
100
30

-----Sample Output-----
2100.000000000000000


The maximum distance is achieved when a train runs as follows:
 - In the first 30 seconds, it accelerates at a rate of 1m/s^2, covering 450 meters.
 - In the subsequent 40 seconds, it maintains the velocity of 30m/s, covering 1200 meters.
 - In the last 30 seconds, it decelerates at the acceleration of -1m/s^2, covering 450 meters.
The total distance covered is 450 + 1200 + 450 = 2100 meters.
