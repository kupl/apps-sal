In Takahashi Kingdom, which once existed, there are N cities, and some pairs of cities are connected bidirectionally by roads.
The following are known about the road network:
 - People traveled between cities only through roads. It was possible to reach any city from any other city, via intermediate cities if necessary.
 - Different roads may have had different lengths, but all the lengths were positive integers.
Snuke the archeologist found a table with N rows and N columns, A, in the ruin of Takahashi Kingdom.
He thought that it represented the shortest distances between the cities along the roads in the kingdom.
Determine whether there exists a road network such that for each u and v, the integer A_{u, v} at the u-th row and v-th column of A is equal to the length of the shortest path from City u to City v.
If such a network exist, find the shortest possible total length of the roads.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 300
 - If i â‰  j, 1 \leq A_{i, j} = A_{j, i} \leq 10^9.
 - A_{i, i} = 0

-----Inputs-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N}
A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N}
...
A_{N, 1} A_{N, 2} ... A_{N, N}

-----Outputs-----
If there exists no network that satisfies the condition, print -1.
If it exists, print the shortest possible total length of the roads.

-----Sample Input-----
3
0 1 3
1 0 2
3 2 0

-----Sample Output-----
3

The network below satisfies the condition:
 - City 1 and City 2 is connected by a road of length 1.
 - City 2 and City 3 is connected by a road of length 2.
 - City 3 and City 1 is not connected by a road.
