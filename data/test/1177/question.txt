Given are a sequence of N integers A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N and a positive integer S.

For a pair of integers (L, R) such that 1\leq L \leq R \leq N, let us define f(L, R) as follows:

 - f(L, R) is the number of sequences of integers (x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_k) such that L \leq x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_k \leq R and A_{x_1}+A_{x_2}+\cdots +A_{x_k} = S.
Find the sum of f(L, R) over all pairs of integers (L, R) such that 1\leq L \leq R\leq N. Since this sum can be enormous, print it modulo 998244353.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 3000
 - 1 \leq S \leq 3000
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 3000

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N S
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

-----Output-----
Print the sum of f(L, R), modulo 998244353.

-----Sample Input-----
3 4
2 2 4

-----Sample Output-----
5

The value of f(L, R) for each pair is as follows, for a total of 5.
 - f(1,1) = 0
 - f(1,2) = 1 (for the sequence (1, 2))
 - f(1,3) = 2 (for (1, 2) and (3))
 - f(2,2) = 0
 - f(2,3) = 1 (for (3))
 - f(3,3) = 1 (for (3))
