In Takahashi Kingdom, there is a east-west railroad and N cities along it, numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., N from west to east.
A company called AtCoder Express possesses M trains, and the train i runs from City L_i to City R_i (it is possible that L_i = R_i).
Takahashi the king is interested in the following Q matters:
 - The number of the trains that runs strictly within the section from City p_i to City q_i, that is, the number of trains j such that p_i \leq L_j and R_j \leq q_i.
Although he is genius, this is too much data to process by himself. Find the answer for each of these Q queries to help him.

-----Constraints-----
 - N is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
 - M is an integer between 1 and 200 \ 000 (inclusive).
 - Q is an integer between 1 and 100 \ 000 (inclusive).
 - 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)
 - 1 \leq p_i \leq q_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq Q)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M Q
L_1 R_1
L_2 R_2
:
L_M R_M
p_1 q_1
p_2 q_2
:
p_Q q_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the number of the trains that runs strictly within the section from City p_i to City q_i.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3 1
1 1
1 2
2 2
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
3

As all the trains runs within the section from City 1 to City 2, the answer to the only query is 3.
