Vanya is doing his maths homework. He has an expression of form $x_{1} \diamond x_{2} \diamond x_{3} \diamond \ldots \diamond x_{n}$, where x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} are digits from 1 to 9, and sign [Image] represents either a plus '+' or the multiplication sign '*'. Vanya needs to add one pair of brackets in this expression so that to maximize the value of the resulting expression.


-----Input-----

The first line contains expression s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5001, |s| is odd), its odd positions only contain digits from 1 to 9, and even positions only contain signs  +  and  * . 

The number of signs  *  doesn't exceed 15.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the maximum possible value of an expression.


-----Examples-----
Input
3+5*7+8*4

Output
303

Input
2+3*5

Output
25

Input
3*4*5

Output
60



-----Note-----

Note to the first sample test. 3 + 5 * (7 + 8) * 4 = 303.

Note to the second sample test. (2 + 3) * 5 = 25.

Note to the third sample test. (3 * 4) * 5 = 60 (also many other variants are valid, for instance, (3) * 4 * 5 = 60).
