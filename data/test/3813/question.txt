We have a tree with N vertices. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree, and the parent of Vertex i (2 \leq i \leq N) is Vertex P_i.
To each vertex in the tree, Snuke will allocate a color, either black or white, and a non-negative integer weight.
Snuke has a favorite integer sequence, X_1, X_2, ..., X_N, so he wants to allocate colors and weights so that the following condition is satisfied for all v.
 - The total weight of the vertices with the same color as v among the vertices contained in the subtree whose root is v, is X_v.
Here, the subtree whose root is v is the tree consisting of Vertex v and all of its descendants.
Determine whether it is possible to allocate colors and weights in this way.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 1 000
 - 1 \leq P_i \leq i - 1
 - 0 \leq X_i \leq 5 000

-----Inputs-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
P_2 P_3 ... P_N
X_1 X_2 ... X_N

-----Outputs-----
If it is possible to allocate colors and weights to the vertices so that the condition is satisfied, print POSSIBLE; otherwise, print IMPOSSIBLE.

-----Sample Input-----
3
1 1
4 3 2

-----Sample Output-----
POSSIBLE

For example, the following allocation satisfies the condition:
 - Set the color of Vertex 1 to white and its weight to 2.
 - Set the color of Vertex 2 to black and its weight to 3.
 - Set the color of Vertex 3 to white and its weight to 2.
There are also other possible allocations.
