The marmots need to prepare k problems for HC^2 over n days. Each problem, once prepared, also has to be printed.

The preparation of a problem on day i (at most one per day) costs a_{i} CHF, and the printing of a problem on day i (also at most one per day) costs b_{i} CHF. Of course, a problem cannot be printed before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).

What is the minimum cost of preparation and printing?


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2200). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_{n} ($1 \leq a_{i} \leq 10^{9}$) — the preparation costs. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, ..., b_{n} ($1 \leq b_{i} \leq 10^{9}$) — the printing costs.


-----Output-----

Output the minimum cost of preparation and printing k problems — that is, the minimum possible sum a_{i}_1 + a_{i}_2 + ... + a_{i}_{k} + b_{j}_1 + b_{j}_2 + ... + b_{j}_{k}, where 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_{k} ≤ n, 1 ≤ j_1 < j_2 < ... < j_{k} ≤ n and i_1 ≤ j_1, i_2 ≤ j_2, ..., i_{k} ≤ j_{k}.


-----Example-----
Input
8 4
3 8 7 9 9 4 6 8
2 5 9 4 3 8 9 1

Output
32


-----Note-----

In the sample testcase, one optimum solution is to prepare the first problem on day 1 and print it on day 1, prepare the second problem on day 2 and print it on day 4, prepare the third problem on day 3 and print it on day 5, and prepare the fourth problem on day 6 and print it on day 8.
