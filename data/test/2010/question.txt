Sereja has got an array, consisting of n integers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Sereja is an active boy, so he is now going to complete m operations. Each operation will have one of the three forms:  Make v_{i}-th array element equal to x_{i}. In other words, perform the assignment a_{v}_{i} = x_{i}.  Increase each array element by y_{i}. In other words, perform n assignments a_{i} = a_{i} + y_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ n).  Take a piece of paper and write out the q_{i}-th array element. That is, the element a_{q}_{i}. 

Help Sereja, complete all his operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the original array.

Next m lines describe operations, the i-th line describes the i-th operation. The first number in the i-th line is integer t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 3) that represents the operation type. If t_{i} = 1, then it is followed by two integers v_{i} and x_{i}, (1 ≤ v_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9). If t_{i} = 2, then it is followed by integer y_{i} (1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ 10^4). And if t_{i} = 3, then it is followed by integer q_{i} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

For each third type operation print value a_{q}_{i}. Print the values in the order, in which the corresponding queries follow in the input.
