Hands that shed innocent blood!

There are n guilty people in a line, the i-th of them holds a claw with length L_{i}. The bell rings and every person kills some of people in front of him. All people kill others at the same time. Namely, the i-th person kills the j-th person if and only if j < i and j ≥ i - L_{i}.

You are given lengths of the claws. You need to find the total number of alive people after the bell rings.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of guilty people.

Second line contains n space-separated integers L_1, L_2, ..., L_{n} (0 ≤ L_{i} ≤ 10^9), where L_{i} is the length of the i-th person's claw.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the total number of alive people after the bell rings.
