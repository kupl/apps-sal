Little penguin Polo likes permutations. But most of all he likes permutations of integers from 0 to n, inclusive.

For permutation p = p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n}, Polo has defined its beauty — number $(0 \oplus p_{0}) +(1 \oplus p_{1}) + \cdots +(n \oplus p_{n})$.

Expression $x \oplus y$ means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is represented as "^" and in Pascal — as "xor".

Help him find among all permutations of integers from 0 to n the permutation with the maximum beauty.


-----Input-----

The single line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).


-----Output-----

In the first line print integer m the maximum possible beauty. In the second line print any permutation of integers from 0 to n with the beauty equal to m.

If there are several suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
