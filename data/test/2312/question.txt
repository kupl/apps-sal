You're given an array $b$ of length $n$. Let's define another array $a$, also of length $n$, for which $a_i = 2^{b_i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$). 

Valerii says that every two non-intersecting subarrays of $a$ have different sums of elements. You want to determine if he is wrong. More formally, you need to determine if there exist four integers $l_1,r_1,l_2,r_2$ that satisfy the following conditions:   $1 \leq l_1 \leq r_1 \lt l_2 \leq r_2 \leq n$;  $a_{l_1}+a_{l_1+1}+\ldots+a_{r_1-1}+a_{r_1} = a_{l_2}+a_{l_2+1}+\ldots+a_{r_2-1}+a_{r_2}$. 

If such four integers exist, you will prove Valerii wrong. Do they exist?

An array $c$ is a subarray of an array $d$ if $c$ can be obtained from $d$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of every test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$).

The second line of every test case contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ ($0 \le b_i \le 10^9$). 


-----Output-----

For every test case, if there exist two non-intersecting subarrays in $a$ that have the same sum, output YES on a separate line. Otherwise, output NO on a separate line. 

Also, note that each letter can be in any case. 


-----Example-----
Input
2
6
4 3 0 1 2 0
2
2 5

Output
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, $a = [16,8,1,2,4,1]$. Choosing $l_1 = 1$, $r_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 2$ and $r_2 = 6$ works because $16 = (8+1+2+4+1)$.

In the second case, you can verify that there is no way to select to such subarrays.
