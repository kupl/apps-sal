First, let us cast the first spell to decrease the monster's health by 8, at the cost of 3 Magic Points. The monster's health is now 1.
Then, cast the third spell to decrease the monster's health by 2, at the cost of 1 Magic Point. The monster's health is now -1.
In this way, we can win at the total cost of 4 Magic Points.
