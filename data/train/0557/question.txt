Prof. Sergio Marquina is a mathematics teacher at the University of Spain. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity k), he gives that question to students within roll number range i and j.
At the start of the semester he assigns a score of 10 to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity k, his score gets multiplied by k.
This month he gave M questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the students. He is busy planning a tour of the Bank of Spain for his students, can you help him?

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains the first line of input, two integers N, M i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month.
- Next M lines contain 3 integers -i,j,k i.e. starting roll number, end roll number, and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, output in a single line answer - floor value of Mean of the maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 105$
- $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
- $1 \leq k \leq 100$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
5 3
1 3 5
2 5 2
3 4 7

-----Sample Output:-----
202

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Initial score of students will be : [10,10,10,10,10]
after solving question 1 scores will be: [50,50,50,10,10]
after solving question 2 scores will be: [50,100,100,20,20]
after solving question 1 scores will be: [50,100,700,140,20]
Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will (50+100+700+140+20)/5=202
