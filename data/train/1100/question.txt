This question is similar to the $"Operation$ $on$ $a$ $Tuple"$ problem in this month's Long Challenge but with a slight variation.

Consider the following operations on a triple of integers. In one operation, you should:

- Choose a positive integer $d>0$ and an arithmetic operation - in this case, it will only be addition.

- Choose a subset of elements of the triple.

- Apply arithmetic operation to each of the chosen elements.

For example, if we have a triple $(3,5,7)$, we may choose to add $3$ to the first and third element, and we get $(6,5,10)$ using one operation.

You are given an initial triple $(p,q,r)$ and a target triple $(a,b,c)$. Find the maximum number of operations needed to transform $(p,q,r)$ into $(a,b,c)$ or say the conversion is impossible .
Input:
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers p, q and r.
- The second line contains three space-separated integers a, b and c.Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum required number of operations(if the conversion is possible), or else print "-1"

Constraints:
- $1 \leq T \leq 1,000$
- $2 \leq |p|,|q|,|r|,|a|,|b|,|c| \leq 10^9$Sample Input:
