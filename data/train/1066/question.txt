CHEF N TIMINGS
-----

One day chef was working with some random numbers. Then he found something
interesting. He observed that no 240, 567, 9999 and 122 and called these numbers
nice as the digits in numbers are in increasing order. Also he called 434, 452, 900
are not nice as digits are in decreasing order

wants you to find out largest "nice" integer which is smaller than or equal to the
given integer.
