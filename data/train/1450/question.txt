Cheffina challanges chef to rearrange the given array as arr[i] > arr[i+1] < arr[i+2] > arr[i+3].. and so onâ€¦, i.e. also arr[i] < arr[i+2] and arr[i+1] < arr[i+3] and arr[i] < arr[i+3] so on.. Chef accepts the challenge, chef starts coding but his code is not compiling help him to write new code.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

- N space-separated distinct integers.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer given to the Chefffina.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^5$
