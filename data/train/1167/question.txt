Tom  has finally taken over the business empire and now looking for 
a new Name of the business to make a new start.

Joe  (Tom's dear friend)  suggested a string $S$  consisting of
Uppercase and lowercase letters   

Tom wants to make some changes as per the following criteria:

1) String should $not$ have any vowels .

2) Every other uppercase consonant(other characters except vowels) should 
be in lowercase

For ex:

If the consonant character is Z then it should be z

3)  There should be  a character "." before each consonant.

Help Tom to make the required Changes.
