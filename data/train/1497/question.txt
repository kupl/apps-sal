Divya's watch of worth Rs10 cr is abducted by N thieves(1,2....i...N). The fight over the watch leads to a final decision that it should belong to the thief who wins a simple game. The rules of the game state that every thief  registers a time in the format HH:MM:SS . Accordingly the average A of three clockwise angles  between the hours , minutes and seconds hands is calculated . Thus the ith thief  with the maximum A wins the game and gets to keep the watch.

The thieves are poor in mathematics and will need your help . Given the number of thieves and their registered time resolves the conflict and help them in choosing the winner 

-----Input-----
First line of input contains T which denotes the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of an integer which denotes the number of thieves thereby N line follow which give the time choosen by each thieve in the format HH:MM:SS.

-----Output:-----
Output single integer i which denotes the ith thief.

-----Constraints:-----

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=50

01<=HH<=12

00<=MM<=60

00<=SS<=60
