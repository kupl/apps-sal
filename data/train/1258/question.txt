Chef Zidane likes the number 9. He has a number N, and he wants to turn it into a multiple of 9. He cannot add or remove digits, and he can only change one digit at a time. The only allowed operation is to increment or decrement a digit by one, and doing this takes exactly one second. Note that he cannot increase a digit 9 or decrease a digit 0, and the resulting number must not contain any leading zeroes unless N has a single digit.

Chef Zidane wants to know the minimum amount of time (in seconds) needed to accomplish this. Please help him, before his kitchen gets overwhelmed with mist!

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of one line containing a single positive integer N.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10105
- N will not contain leading zeroes.
- Each test file is at most 3Mb in size.

-----Example-----
Input:4
1989
86236
90210
99999999999999999999999999999999999999988

Output:0
2
3
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. 1989 is already divisible by 9, so no operations are needed to be performed.
Example case 2. 86236 can be turned into a multiple of 9 by incrementing the first and third digit (from the left), to get 96336. This takes 2 seconds.
Example case 3. 90210 can be turned into a multiple of 9 by decrementing the third digit twice and the fourth digit once, to get 90000. This takes 3 seconds.
