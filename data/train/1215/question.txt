Two friends David and Rojer were preparing for their weekly class-test.
The are preparing for the math test, but because of continuously adding big integers and solving equations they got exhausted. They decided to take break and play a game. They play a game which will help them in both(for having fun and will also help to prepare for math test).
There are N words and they have to find RESULT with the help of these words (just like they have N integers and they have to find integer RESULT=sum of N integers) . Since they are playing this game for the first time! They are not too good in this. Help them in finding weather their RESULT is correct or not.   
NOTE:- Total number of unique characters in N words are not greater than 10. All input words and RESULT are in UPPER-CASE only!

If RESULT is correct print true else print false.

-----Sample Input:-----
3

THIS

IS

TOO

FUNNY  

-----Sample Output:-----
true

-----Constraints-----
- $2 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq Length of The word \leq 10$
- $1 \leq Length of The Result \leq 11$
