You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide.

We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good.

The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$.

Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the number of points.

The next n lines of input contain five integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}, d_{i}, e_{i} (|a_{i}|, |b_{i}|, |c_{i}|, |d_{i}|, |e_{i}| ≤ 10^3)  — the coordinates of the i-th point. All points are distinct.


-----Output-----

First, print a single integer k — the number of good points.

Then, print k integers, each on their own line — the indices of the good points in ascending order.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, the first point forms exactly a $90^{\circ}$ angle with all other pairs of points, so it is good.

In the second sample, along the cd plane, we can see the points look as follows:

We can see that all angles here are acute, so no points are good.
