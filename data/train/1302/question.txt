The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles. The number of tiles present in  $i^{th}$ box is  $i$  ($i   $ varies from $1$ to $N$) . The Chef  has two houses  with  $N$  rooms  each, whose  floors  is a square with area $(i*i)$ ,i varies from $(1....N)$. He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled completely.
Since chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.

A room should be tilled completely from a single box.
