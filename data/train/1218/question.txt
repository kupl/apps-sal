Richik$Richik$ has just completed his engineering and has got a job in one of the firms at Sabrina$Sabrina$ which is ranked among the top seven islands in the world in terms of the pay scale. 
Since Richik$Richik$ has to travel a lot to reach the firm, the owner assigns him a number X$X$, and asks him to come to work only on the day which is a multiple of X$X$. Richik joins the firm on 1-st day but starts working from X-th day. Richik$Richik$ is paid exactly the same amount in Dollars as the day number.
