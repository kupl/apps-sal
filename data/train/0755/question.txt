Akshay is interested in mathematics, one day he came across a problem of modulus operator.He has  a list of M integers say arr[M] and has to find all integers K such that :
- K > 1
- arr[1]%K = arr[2]%K = arr[3]%K = â€¦ = arr[M]%K where '%' is a modulus operator.
Help Akshay to find all such K's.

-----Input:-----
- First line of input contains an integer M. Then M lines follow each containing one integer of the list. Input data is such that at least one integer K will always exist.

-----Output:-----
- Output all possible integers K separated by space in increasing order.

-----Constraints-----
- 2<= M <=100
- 1< value of each integer <109
- All integers will be distinct

-----Sample Input:-----
3
38
6
34

-----Sample Output:-----
2 4
