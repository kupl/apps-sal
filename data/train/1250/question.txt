Our chef has been assigned a task to make a necklace of length N, from gold, diamond and platinum.There is single kind of gold, two types of diamond and three types of platinum available.
A necklace can be represented as strings of the form (G)∗(D1|D2)∗(P1|P2|P3)∗$ (G)*(D1|D2)*(P1|P2|P3)* $ where (x|y) means we can use x or y and ∗$ * $ means we can repeat the previous parenthesized expression 0 or more times.
Instead of making necklace he choose to count all such distinct necklaces possible for a given length N.

-----Input:-----
-The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
-Only line of every test case contains an integer N$N$ denoting the length of the necklace required.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print the number of all such distinct necklaces, with given length. As the number can be really large, print it modulo  109+7$10^{9}+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- 1≤T≤10000$1 \leq T \leq 10000$
- 2≤N≤1000000000$2 \leq N \leq 1000000000$
- String S$S$ consists of only upper case english alphabets.
