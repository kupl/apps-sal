This is a peculiar functioning setup.
Two Tanks are separated from each other by a wall .There is a pipe in the wall which connects  both tanks  which allows flow of water between them . Due to this ,there is change in temperature of both tanks , every minute temperature of Tank with larger temperature among two decreases by one and temperature of Tank  with smaller temperature among two increases by two until equilibrium is reached , But there is a problem .
The pipe can't control this flow of water if there is Non-equilibrium (inequality of temperature  on  both sides )  even after $m$ minutes and the pipe will burst after it , your task is to predict whether the pipe will burst or not .
Note: If equilibrium cannot be reached the process will continue forever.
The initial temperature of Cold Tank is $Tc$ , of Hot Tank it is $Th$. 

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three  integers $m, Tc,Th$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer "Yes" if Pipe will burst after m minutes "No" if pipe will not burst.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq m,Tc,Th \leq 10^9$
- $Tc \leq Th $

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 5 10
2 2 5

-----Sample Output:-----
Yes
No
