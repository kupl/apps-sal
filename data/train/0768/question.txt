The MEX of a set of integers is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to this set. For example, $\mathrm{MEX}(\{0,2,3\}) = 1$ and $\mathrm{MEX}(\{1,3\}) = 0$.
Chef has a tree with $N$ nodes (numbered $1$ through $N$). The tree is rooted at node $1$. Chef wants to assign a non-negative integer to each node in such a way that each integer between $0$ and $N-1$ (inclusive) is assigned to exactly one node.
For each node $u$, consider the integers assigned to the nodes in the subtree of $u$ (including $u$); let $a_u$ denote the MEX of these integers. Chef wants $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_N$ to be as large as possible. Find the maximum possible value of this sum.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N-1$ space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{N-1}$. For each valid $i$, the node $p_i$ is the parent of the node $i+1$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum sum of subtree MEX-s which can be obtained if you assign the weights optimally.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 5$
- $2 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le p_i < i$ for each valid $i$
