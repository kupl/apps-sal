There is Chef and Chef’s Crush who are playing a game of numbers.

Chef’s crush has a number $A$ and Chef has a number $B$.

Now, Chef wants Chef’s crush to win the game always, since she is his crush. The game ends when the greatest value of A^B is reached after performing some number of operations (possibly zero), Where ^ is Bitwise XOR.

Before performing any operation you have to ensure that both $A$ and $B$ have the same number of bits without any change in the values. It is not guaranteed that $A$ and $B$ should have same number of bits in the input.
For example, if $A$ is $2$ and $B$ is $15$, then the binary representation of both the numbers will have to be $0010$ and $1111$ respectively, before performing any operation.  
The operation is defined as  : 
- Right circular shift of the bits of only $B$ from MSB$_B$ to LSB$_B$ i.e. if we consider $B_1 B_2 B_3 B_4$ as binary number, then after one circular right shift, it would be $B_4 B_1 B_2 B_3$
They both are busy with themselves, can you find the number of operations to end the game?

-----Input :-----
- The first line of input contains $T$, (number of test cases)  
- Then each of the next $T$ lines contain : two integers $A$ and $B$ respectively.

-----Output :-----
For each test case print two space-separated integers, The number of operations to end the game and value of A^B when the game ends.

-----Constraints :-----
- $1 \leq T \leq100$ 
- $1\leq A,B \leq 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks  :-----
- 30 Points: $1\leq A,B \leq 10^5$
- 70 Points: Original Constraints

-----Sample Input :-----
1
4 5

-----Sample Output :-----
2 7

-----Explanation  :-----
Binary  representation of  $4$ is $100$ and binary  representation  $5$ is $101$.   
- After operation $1$ : $B$ $=$ $110$, so A^B $=$ $2$ 
- After operation $2$ : $B$ $=$ $011$, so A^B $=$ $7$ 
So, the value of A^B will be $7$. Which is the greatest possible value for A^B and the number of operations are $2$.
