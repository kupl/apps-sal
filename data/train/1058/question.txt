There is a popular apps named “Exbook” like “Facebook”. To sign up in this app , You have to make a strong password with more than 3 digits and less than 10 digits . But I am a pro hacker and so I make a Exbook hacking site . You need to login in this site to hack exbook account and then you will get a portal. You can give any user exbook login link using this site and when anyone login into exbook using your link ,you can see his/her password .
But I made a mistake and so you cannot find original password in your portal . The portal showing you by adding two in every digit . So , now you have to find out the original password of an user if I give you the password which is showing in your portal .

-----Input:-----
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n which is showing in your portal . Mind it , every digit of n is greater than one .

-----Output:-----
Print , original password of user .

-----Sample Input:-----
