Chef solved so many hard questions, now he wants to solve some easy problems for refreshment. Chef asks Cheffina for the new question. Cheffina challenges the chef to print the total number of 0's in the binary representation of N(natural number).

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
2
4

-----Sample Output:-----
1
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) Binary representation of 2 is 10. i.e. only one 0 present in it.
For 2) Binary representation of 4 is 100, i.e. two 0's present in it.
