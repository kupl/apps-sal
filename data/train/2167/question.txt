A function $f : R \rightarrow R$ is called Lipschitz continuous if there is a real constant K such that the inequality |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ K·|x - y| holds for all $x, y \in R$. We'll deal with a more... discrete version of this term.

For an array $h [ 1 . . n ]$, we define it's Lipschitz constant $L(h)$ as follows:  if n < 2, $L(h) = 0$  if n ≥ 2, $L(h) = \operatorname{max} [ \frac{|h [ j ] - h [ i ]|}{j - i} ]$ over all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n 

In other words, $L = L(h)$ is the smallest non-negative integer such that |h[i] - h[j]| ≤ L·|i - j| holds for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

You are given an array [Image] of size n and q queries of the form [l, r]. For each query, consider the subarray $s = a [ l . . r ]$; determine the sum of Lipschitz constants of all subarrays of $S$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100) — the number of elements in array [Image] and the number of queries respectively.

The second line contains n space-separated integers $a [ 1 . . n ]$ ($0 \leq a [ i ] \leq 10^{8}$).

The following q lines describe queries. The i-th of those lines contains two space-separated integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ n).


-----Output-----

Print the answers to all queries in the order in which they are given in the input. For the i-th query, print one line containing a single integer — the sum of Lipschitz constants of all subarrays of [Image].

-----Note-----

In the first query of the first sample, the Lipschitz constants of subarrays of $[ 5,2,9 ]$ with length at least 2 are:  $L([ 5,2 ]) = 3$  $L([ 2,9 ]) = 7$  $L([ 5,2,9 ]) = 7$ 

The answer to the query is their sum.
