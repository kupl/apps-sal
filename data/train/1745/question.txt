This calculator takes values that could be written in a browsers route path as a single string. It then returns the result as a number (or an error message).

Route paths use the '/' symbol so this can't be in our calculator. Instead we are using the '$' symbol as our divide operator.

You will be passed a string of any length containing numbers and operators:

* '+' = add        
* '-' = subtract  
* '*' = multiply 
* '$' = divide   

Your task is to break the string down and calculate the expression using this order of operations. (division => multiplication => subtraction => addition)

If you are given an invalid input (i.e. any character except `.0123456789+-*$`) you should return the error message:`'400: Bad request'`

### Remember:

1. Operations are infinite
2. Order of operations is imperitive
3. No `eval` or equivalent functions

**Examples:**
```python
calculate('1+1')     => '2'
calculate('10$2')    => '5'
calculate('1.5*3')   => '4.5'

calculate('5+5+5+5') => '20'

calculate('1000$2.5$5+5-5+6$6') =>'81'

calculate('10-9p')   =>  '400: Bad request'
```

### Further Notes - Parameters outside of this challenge:

- Brackets e.g. 10*(1+2)
- Square root, log, % or any other operators
- Unary minus (10*-1)
- Bad mathematical input (10**$10 or 5+5$)
- You may have to deal with floats
