For strings s and t, we will say that s and t are prefix-free when neither is a prefix of the other.
Let L be a positive integer. A set of strings S is a good string set when the following conditions hold true:
 - Each string in S has a length between 1 and L (inclusive) and consists of the characters 0 and 1.
 - Any two distinct strings in S are prefix-free.
We have a good string set S = \{ s_1, s_2, ..., s_N \}. Alice and Bob will play a game against each other. They will alternately perform the following operation, starting from Alice:
 - Add a new string to S. After addition, S must still be a good string set.
The first player who becomes unable to perform the operation loses the game. Determine the winner of the game when both players play optimally.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
 - 1 \leq L \leq 10^{18}
 - s_1, s_2, ..., s_N are all distinct.
 - { s_1, s_2, ..., s_N } is a good string set.
 - |s_1| + |s_2| + ... + |s_N| \leq 10^5

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N L
s_1
s_2
:
s_N

-----Output-----
If Alice will win, print Alice; if Bob will win, print Bob.

-----Sample Input-----
2 2
00
01

-----Sample Output-----
Alice

If Alice adds 1, Bob will be unable to add a new string.
