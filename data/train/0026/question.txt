You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$ 

The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece. 

Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.


-----Input-----

The test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n,m \le 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each test case output a single line containing "YES" if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
3
1 3
100000 100000
2 2

Output
YES
NO
YES



-----Note-----

For the first test case, this is an example solution:  [Image] 

For the second test case, we can show that no solution exists.

For the third test case, this is an example solution: $\left\{\begin{array}{l}{3} \\{3} \end{array} \right\}$
