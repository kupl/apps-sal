Shaun is very much interested in Subarrays. Shaun wants to count the number of subarrays in his chosen array with sum being a multiple of $10^9$. Since, Shaun is interested in huge numbers.He chose his array such that it contains only $10^8$ and $9*10^8$ as its elements.
Help shaun to count the number of required subarrays.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- First line of each testcase contains one integer $N$,size of array $A$. 
- Second line of each testcase contains $N$ space separated array elements

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line number of subarrays with sum being multiple of $10^9$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $A[i]$=$10^8$ , $9*10^8$

-----Sample Input:-----
