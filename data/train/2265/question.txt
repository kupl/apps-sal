You are given a permutation of 1,2,...,N: p_1,p_2,...,p_N. Determine if the state where p_i=i for every i can be reached by performing the following operation any number of times:
 - Choose three elements p_{i-1},p_{i},p_{i+1} (2\leq i\leq N-1) such that p_{i-1}>p_{i}>p_{i+1} and reverse the order of these three.

-----Constraints-----
 - 3 \leq N \leq 3 Ã— 10^5
 - p_1,p_2,...,p_N is a permutation of 1,2,...,N.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
p_1
:
p_N

-----Output-----
If the state where p_i=i for every i can be reached by performing the operation, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
5
5
2
1
4
3

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

The state where p_i=i for every i can be reached as follows:
 - Reverse the order of p_1,p_2,p_3. The sequence p becomes 1,2,5,4,3.
 - Reverse the order of p_3,p_4,p_5. The sequence p becomes 1,2,3,4,5.
