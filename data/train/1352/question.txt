Chef is very organised in whatever he does and likes to maintain statistics of his work. Chef has expertise in web development and hence is a regular contributor on a forum. Chef sometimes makes multiple contributions in a single day.. Each day chef makes at least 1 contribution he is assigned a shade of green. The greater the number of contribution in a single day the darker shade of green he gets assigned and vice versa. Your job is to find out the number of days chef is assigned a same shade of green and print the number of times chef is assigned a unique shade of green.

-----INPUT-----
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of days chef has contributed towards the forum.

The next line contains N spaced integers the number of contributions chef has made if he has made any.

-----OUTPUT-----

The output will contain numbers on separate lines that show the number of individual green shades chef has earned in ascending order of intensity of the shades of green.

-----CONSTRAINTS-----
1 <= T <= 25

5 <= N <= 50

1 <= Ai <= 50

-----EXAMPLE-----Input:
