Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):
 - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100
 - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9
 - M is prime.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K M

-----Output-----
Use the following format:
c_1
c_2
:
c_N

Here, c_x should be the number, modulo M, of multisets such that the average of the elements is x.

-----Sample Input-----
3 1 998244353

-----Sample Output-----
1
3
1

Consider non-empty multisets containing between 0 and 1 instance(s) of each of the integers between 1 and 3. Among them, there are:
 - one multiset such that the average of the elements is k = 1: \{1\};
 - three multisets such that the average of the elements is k = 2: \{2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\};
 - one multiset such that the average of the elements is k = 3: \{3\}.
