RANJANA QUIZ
-----

Prof. Ranjana decided to conduct a quiz in her class. She divided all the students of her
class into groups of three. Consider that no student was left out after the division. She gave
different sets of questions to every group. A set is said to be unique if there is no other team that
received the same number of maths, science and english questions. In every set, maximum
questions for each group were related to maths, then science, and the least number of
questions were related to English. Total number of questions given to each team can be
different. 

	
	

After the test, the CR of the class asked every team to report the number of questions
they got on each subject. The CR wants to know the number of unique sets of questions that
were given to the teams, the problem is that all the students have just submitted the number of
questions of each subject but in no particular order. Help the CR to find the number of unique
sets
