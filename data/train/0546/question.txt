Motu and Patlu are playing with a Magical Ball. Patlu find some interesting pattern in the motion of the ball that ball always bounce back from the ground after travelling a linear distance whose value is some power of $2$. Patlu gave Motu total distance $D$ travelled by the ball and ask him to calculate the minimum number of bounces that the ball makes before coming to rest.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, single integers $D$.
- Note : Power of $2$ must be a non-negative integer. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer, the minimum number of bounces the ball makes before coming to rest.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1$ $\leq$ $M$< $10$^18

-----Sample Input:-----

-----Sample Output:-----
