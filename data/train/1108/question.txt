There were $N$ students (numbered $1$ through $N$) participating in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of $K$ lectures (numbered $1$ through $K$). For each student $i$ and each lecture $j$, the $i$-th student watched the $j$-th lecture for $T_{i, j}$ minutes.
Additionally, for each student $i$, we know that this student asked the question, "What is the criteria for getting a certificate?" $Q_i$ times.
The criteria for getting a certificate is that a student must have watched at least $M$ minutes of lectures in total and they must have asked the question no more than $10$ times.
Find out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$.
- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains $K+1$ space-separated integers $T_{i, 1}, T_{i, 2}, \ldots, T_{i, K}, Q_i$.

-----Output-----
Print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of participants eligible for a certificate. 

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le N, K \le 1,000$
- $1 \le M \le 10^6$
- $1 \le Q_i \le 10^6$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le T_{i, j} \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$ and $j$

-----Example Input-----
4 8 4
1 2 1 2 5
3 5 1 3 4
1 2 4 5 11
1 1 1 3 12

-----Example Output-----
1

-----Explanation-----
- Participant $1$ watched $1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $5$ times. Since $6 < M$, this participant does not receive a certificate.
- Participant $2$ watched $3 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 12$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $4$ times. Since $12 \ge M$ and $4 \le 10$, this participant receives a certificate.
- Participant $3$ watched $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $11$ times. Since $12 \ge M$ but $11 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.
- Participant $4$ watched $1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6$ minutes of lectures and asked the question $12$ times. Since $6 < M$ and $12 > 10$, this participant does not receive a certificate.
Only participant $2$ receives a certificate.
