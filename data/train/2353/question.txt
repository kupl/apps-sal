You are given an array a with n distinct integers. Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_{x_{i}} \neq \sum_{i = 1}^{k} b_{x_{i}}$


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.

The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.


-----Output-----

If there is no such array b, print -1.

Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. Note that b must be a permutation of a.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 2

Output
2 1 

Input
4
1000 100 10 1

Output
100 1 1000 10



-----Note-----

An array x is a permutation of y, if we can shuffle elements of y such that it will coincide with x.

Note that the empty subset and the subset containing all indices are not counted.
