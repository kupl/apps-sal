Once, a genius guy Cristo visited NASA where he met many scientists. A young intern Mark at NASA asked Cristo to observe the strange behaviour of two

independent particles (say Alpha and Beta) moving in the free space.Cristo was astonished to see the movement of Alpha and Beta. However, he formulated a procedure

to evaluate the distance covered by the particles in given time.
The procedure calculates the distance covered by Alpha and Beta for a given time. Mark, however struggles

to evaluate the procedure manually and asks you to help him. 
Cristo's Procedure :- 
alpha = 0
beta = 0
Procedure CristoSutra( Ti ) :
if Ti <= 0 :
alpha = alpha + 1 
else if Ti == 1 :
	beta = beta + 1
else :
CristoSutra(Ti-1)
	         CristoSutra(Ti-2)
	         CristoSutra(Ti-3)
end procedure
Note: Print the answer by taking mod from 109+7 .
