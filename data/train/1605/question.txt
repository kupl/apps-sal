Dreamoon loves summing up something for no reason. One day he obtains two integers a and b occasionally. He wants to calculate the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer x is called nice if $\operatorname{mod}(x, b) \neq 0$ and $\frac{\operatorname{div}(x, b)}{\operatorname{mod}(x, b)} = k$, where k is some integer number in range [1, a].

By $\operatorname{div}(x, y)$ we denote the quotient of integer division of x and y. By $\operatorname{mod}(x, y)$ we denote the remainder of integer division of x and y. You can read more about these operations here: http://goo.gl/AcsXhT.

The answer may be large, so please print its remainder modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). Can you compute it faster than Dreamoon?


-----Input-----

The single line of the input contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^7).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer representing the answer modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 1

Output
0

Input
2 2

Output
8



-----Note-----

For the first sample, there are no nice integers because $\operatorname{mod}(x, 1)$ is always zero.

For the second sample, the set of nice integers is {3, 5}.
