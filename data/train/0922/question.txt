-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains three lines of input.
- First-line has two integers $N, M$. 
- Second-line with N space-separated numbers.
- Third-line with M space-separated numbers.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq M \leq 10^5$
