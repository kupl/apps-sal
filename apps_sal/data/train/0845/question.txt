Sample Input 

2

2 2

6 9

Sample Output 

1

6

Explanation 
	

The 1st testcase has a biscuit whose original dimensions are 2 X 2, the biscuit is uncut and is a square.

Hence the answer is 1.

The 2nd testcase has a biscuit of size 6 X 9 . We can cut it into 54 squares of size 1 X 1 , 6 of size 3 X 3 . For other sizes we will have leftovers.

Hence, the number of squares of maximum size that can be cut is 6.
