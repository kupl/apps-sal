Sweetness of Apple on a given node is changed. $format$ - type of query node new sweetness(2 3 10)
$Note$: $Jaggu$ is always on the top of tree initially in each query.The sweetness is always positive.
Help $Jaggu$ in saving $Bheem$

-----Input:-----
- First line contains $N$ - (number of nodes).  
- Next line contains $N$ integers with space giving sweetness of apple on Nodes $(1 to N)$
- Next $N-1$ lines contain  $N1$ $N2$ connected nodes.
- Next line contains single integer $Q$ Number of queries

-----Output:-----
- For each query of type 1, print total sweetness of apples. 

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^4$
- $2 \leq Q \leq 10^4$
