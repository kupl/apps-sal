Chef is interested to solve series problems. Chef wants to solve a series problem but he can't 
solve it till now.Can you help Chef to solve the series problem?
- In series problem, the series goes as follows 1,9,31,73,141 . . . . . . . . 
Your task is to find the Nth term of series. For larger value of $N$ answer becomes very large, So your output should be performed $N$th term modulo 1000000007 ($10^9+7$ ).

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase,  output in a single line answer i.e. The $N$th term of series modulo 1000000007.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
