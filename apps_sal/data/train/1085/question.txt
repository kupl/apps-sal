-----Problem-----

			Once THANMAY met PK who is from a different planet visiting earth. THANMAY was very fascinate to learn PK's language. The language contains only lowercase English letters and is based on a simple logic that only certain characters can follow a particular character.


			Now he is interested in calculating the number of possible words of length L and ending at a particular character C. Help THANMAY to calculate this value. 

-----Input-----

			The input begins with 26 lines, each containing 26 space-separated integers. The integers can be either 0 or 1. The jth integer at ith line depicts whether jth English alphabet can follow ith English alphabet or not.


			 Next line contains an integer T. T is the number of queries.

			 Next T lines contains a character C and an integer L.

-----Output-----

			For each query output the count of words of length L ending with the character C. Answer to each query must be followed by newline character.


			The answer may be very large so print it modulo 1000000007.

-----Constraints-----
- 
					1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 
C is lowercase English alphabet.

- 
					2 ≤ L ≤ 10000000

-----Sample Output-----
1

2

-----Explanation-----

			For query 1, Words of length 3 are: aba, acb, bab, bac, cba. The only word ending with 'c' is bac.
