We have a sandglass consisting of two bulbs, bulb A and bulb B. These bulbs contain some amount of sand.
When we put the sandglass, either bulb A or B lies on top of the other and becomes the upper bulb. The other bulb becomes the lower bulb.
The sand drops from the upper bulb to the lower bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second.
When the upper bulb no longer contains any sand, nothing happens.
Initially at time 0, bulb A is the upper bulb and contains a grams of sand; bulb B contains X-a grams of sand (for a total of X grams).
We will turn over the sandglass at time r_1,r_2,..,r_K. Assume that this is an instantaneous action and takes no time. Here, time t refer to the time t seconds after time 0.
You are given Q queries.
Each query is in the form of (t_i,a_i).
For each query, assume that a=a_i and find the amount of sand that would be contained in bulb A at time t_i.

In the first query, 30 out of the initial 90 grams of sand will drop from bulb A, resulting in 60 grams.
In the second query, the initial 1 gram of sand will drop from bulb A, and nothing will happen for the next 59 seconds. Then, we will turn over the sandglass, and 1 second after this, bulb A contains 1 gram of sand at the time in question.
