## A Knight's Tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

Traditional chess boards are 8x8 grids, but for this kata we are interested in generating tours for any square board sizes.

You will be asked to find a knight's path for any NxN board from any start position.

I have provided a tool to visualize the output of your code at the following link: http://jsfiddle.net/7sbyya59/2/

EDIT: The expected output is a 2D array `(n x 2)` comprised of the `[x,y]` coordinates of the Knight's path taken in sequential order. (e.g. `[[2,3],[4,4],...,[x,y]]`)

All test cases will have a passing solution.
