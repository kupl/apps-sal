Chef has some numbers. His girlfriend Chefina feels good when chef gives her a particular pattern number also called as Armstrong number.
Armstrong number is a number whose sum of its all individual digit raise to the power of the number of digit in that number is equal to that number itself
eg.. 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 (153 is an Armstrong number)
1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 (1634 is an Armstrong number)
As a love guru of chef you have to help chef to find Armstrong numbers Among the numbers which chef has initially so that Chefina feels good

-----Input:-----

Next $T$ lines follows an Integer $N$.

-----Output:-----
For Every n You have to print "FEELS GOOD" without qoutes if it is an armstrong number otherwise Print "FEELS BAD" without quotes

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^6$

-----Sample Input:-----
3
153
11
1634

-----Sample Output:-----
FEELS GOOD
FEELS BAD
FEELS GOOD

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For test case 1 --> 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 (153 is an armstrong number)
