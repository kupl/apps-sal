        letâ€™s define sum as the sum of all the numbers, before any moves; 
            minNum as the min number int the list; 
            n is the length of the list;

        After, say m moves, we get all the numbers as x , and we will get the following equation

        sum + m * (n - 1) = x * n
        and actually,

          x = minNum + m
        and finally, we will get

          sum - minNum * n = m
        So, it is clear and easy now.
