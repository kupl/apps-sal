Ted$Ted$ loves prime numbers. One day he is playing a game called legendary$legendary$ with his girlfriend Robin$Robin$. Ted$Ted$ writes a number N$N$ on a table and the number is in the form of :
N = P1A1 *  P2A2 * ……….. * PnAn
Ted$Ted$ asks Robin$Robin$ to find the sum of all the numbers which are less than or equal to N$N$ and also contains all the primes whose minimum power in the number is given by an array B$B$.  
As Robin$Robin$ is bad with maths she asks your help to answer this question.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.  
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$n$, represents a number of distinct prime numbers.
- The second line of each test case contains n$n$ space separated distinct prime numbers which represents an array P$P$.
- The third line of each test case contains n$n$ space separated integers which represents an array A$A$.
- The fourth line of each test case contains n$n$ space separated integers which represents an array B$B$ 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output the Answer Modulo 109 + 7 in a single line.

-----Constraints-----
- 1≤T≤3$1 \leq T \leq 3$
- 1≤n≤105$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- 2≤Pi≤106$2 \leq P_{i} \leq 10^6$
- 1≤Ai≤109$1 \leq A_{i} \leq 10^9$
- 0≤Bi≤Ai$0 \leq B_{i} \leq Ai$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
2 3 5
2 1 2
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
540

-----EXPLANATION:-----
22 * 31 * 52= 300 which is N over here. 
The four numbers less than or equal to 300 are 30, 60, 150 and 300.

30 = 21 * 31 * 51 , 60 =  22 * 31 * 51, 150 =  21 * 31 * 52 and 300 =  22 * 31 * 52. 
In the 4 numbers, the minimum powers for 2, 3 and 5 are 1, 1 and 1 or more than them in every case.
