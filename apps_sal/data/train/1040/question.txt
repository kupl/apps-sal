A string with length $L$ is called rich if $L \ge 3$ and there is a character which occurs in this string strictly more than $L/2$ times.
You are given a string $S$ and you should answer $Q$ queries on this string. In each query, you are given a substring $S_L, S_{L+1}, \ldots, S_R$. Consider all substrings of this substring. You have to determine whether at least one of them is rich.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$.
- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.
- Each of the next $Q$ lines contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$ describing a query.

-----Output-----
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given substring contains a rich substring or "NO" if it does not contain any rich substring.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le N$
- $S$ contains only lowercase English letters
