Supermarket Dilemma
Chef is going to local supermarket but there appears a problem with chef as he is confused about which Supermarket he can choose to go as he is not able to decide whether he can park his car in that particular supermarket’s parking lot or not! There are N parking slots in each supermarket which are marked from 1,2,3,4…N.
Chef will go to that supermarket in which he gets to know that there is exactly 1 empty parking slot having number K that exactly divides the total number of slots (N) available in that supermarket.
