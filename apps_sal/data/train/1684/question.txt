Laxman, a great Mathematician and Thinker, gives Sugreev an integer, $N$, and asks him to make an array $A$ of length $N$, such that  $\sum A$i$^3 = X^2$, to prove the purity of the bond of his friendship with Ram. Sugreev is facing difficulty in forming the array. So, help Sugreev to form this array.

-----Note:-----
- $A$i must be an integer between $1$ to $10^3$ (both inclusive), where $A$i denotes the $i$$th$ element of the array, $A$.
- $X$ must be an integer (Any Integer).
- If there are multiple solutions, satisfying the condition, you can print any "one" solution.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then, the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains a single line of input, integer $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line, array $A$ of $N$ integers, where each element is between $1$ to $1000$ (both inclusive), satisfying the equation $\sum A$i$^3 = X^2$, where $X$ is "any" integer.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$
