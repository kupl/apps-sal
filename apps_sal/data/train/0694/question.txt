The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?
