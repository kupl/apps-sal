A robot is initially at $(0,0)$ on the cartesian plane. It can move in 4 directions - up, down, left, right denoted by letter u, d, l, r respectively. More formally:
- if the position of robot is $(x,y)$ then u makes it $(x,y+1)$
- if the position of robot is $(x,y)$ then l makes it $(x-1,y)$
- if the position of robot is $(x,y)$ then d makes it $(x,y-1)$
- if the position of robot is $(x,y)$ then r makes it $(x+1,y)$
The robot is performing a counter-clockwise spiral movement such that his movement can be represented by the following sequence of moves -
ulddrruuulllddddrrrruuuuu… and so on.
A single move takes 1 sec. You have to find out the position of the robot on the cartesian plane at $t$ second.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $t$.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print two space-separated integers, $(x,y)$ — the position of the robot.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$
- $1 \leq t \leq 10^{18}$
