Your task is to implement a function that calculates an election winner from a list of voter selections using an [Instant Runoff Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) algorithm. If you haven't heard of IRV, here's a basic overview (slightly altered for this kata):

- Each voter selects several candidates in order of preference.
- The votes are tallied from the each voter's first choice.
- If the first-place candidate has more than half the total votes, they win.
- Otherwise, find the candidate who got the least votes and remove them from each person's voting list.
- In case of a tie for least, remove all of the tying candidates.
- In case of a complete tie between every candidate, return nil(Ruby)/None(Python)/undefined(JS).
- Start over.
- Continue until somebody has more than half the votes; they are the winner.

Your function will be given a list of voter ballots; each ballot will be a list of candidates (symbols) in descending order of preference. You should return the symbol corresponding to the winning candidate. See the default test for an example!
