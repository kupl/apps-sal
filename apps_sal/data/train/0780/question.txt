-----Output-----
Output the minimum value for each test case 

-----Constraints-----
1 = T = 20
1 <= N <= 10^18 
1 <= M<= 10^9 

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 : (20 points)
1 = T = 20
1 <= N <= 100 
1 <= M<= 100 

Subtask 2 : (80 points) 

1 = T = 20
1 <= N <= 10^18 
1 <= M<= 10^9 

-----Example-----
