Since due to COVID 19, India has undergone a complete 21 day lockdown. So Amol was attending an online lecture where his professor asked him to solve a question. Amol was unable to solve the question so he asked you to solve the question and give him the correct answer. 

The question was asked a such that his professor gave him a number M and a list of integers of length N (i.e. A1, A2,..... AN) and you have to find out all the subsets that add up to M and the total number of subsets will be the final answer. 

Input: 
• The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

• The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 

• The second line of each test case contains a single integer M. 

• The third line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2,..... AN. 

Output: 
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the no. of subsets that adds upto M.

Constraints: 
• 1≤T≤5

• 1≤N≤100 

• 10≤M≤100 

• 1≤Ai≤100

20 

2 8 12 10 

Output:

2

2

Explanation:
In the 1st example there are two subsets {2,4,10} and {6,10} that adds upto 16 so the output is 2.
