Chef is playing a game with his childhood friend. He gave his friend a list of N numbers named $a_1, a_2 ....  a_N$ (Note: All numbers are unique). Adjust the numbers in the following order:
$(i)$ swap every alternate number with it's succeeding number (If N is odd, do not swap the last number i.e. $a_N$ ).
$(ii)$ add %3 of every number to itself.
$(iii)$ swap the ith number and the (N-i-1) th number.
After this, Chef will give a number to his friend and he has to give the nearest greater and smaller number to it.
If there is no greater or lesser number, put -1.
Help his friend to find the two numbers.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, an integers $N$. 
- Next line contains $N$ integers separated by a space. 
- Next line contains a number to be found, $M$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer given the immediate smaller and greater number separated by a space.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $3 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N_i \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq M \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
10
5 15 1 66 55 32 40 22 34 11
38

-----Sample Output:-----
35 41

-----Explaination:-----
Step 1: 15 5 66 1 32 55 22 40 11 34
Step 2: 15 7 66 2 34 56 23 41 13 35
Step 3: 35  13 41 23 56 34 2 66 7 15
35 is the number lesser than 38 and 41 is the number greater than 38 in the given set of numbers.
