Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is such maximum element x_{j}, that the following inequality holds: $x_{j} \neq \operatorname{max}_{i = 1}^{k} x_{i}$.

The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.

You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (n > 1). Let's denote sequence s_{l}, s_{l} + 1, ..., s_{r} as s[l..r] (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].

Note that as all numbers in sequence s are distinct, all the given definitions make sence.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 < n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n distinct integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].


-----Examples-----
Input
5
5 2 1 4 3

Output
7

Input
5
9 8 3 5 7

Output
15



-----Note-----

For the first sample you can choose s[4..5] = {4, 3} and its lucky number is (4 xor 3) = 7. You can also choose s[1..2].

For the second sample you must choose s[2..5] = {8, 3, 5, 7}.
