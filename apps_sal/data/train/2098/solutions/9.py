Let's iterate over final number of votes for The United Party of Berland.
We can see that all opponents should get less votes than our party,
and our party should get at least our chosen number of votes.

We can sort all voters by their costs, and solve the problem in two passes.
First, if we need to get 洧논 votes, we should definitely buy all cheap votes for parties that have at least 洧논 votes.
Second, if we don't have 洧논 votes yet, we should by the cheapest votes to get 洧논 votes.
We can see that this solution is optimal: consider the optimal answer, and see how many votes The United Party got.
We tried such number of votes, and we tried to achieve this number of votes by cheapest way, so we couldn't miss the
optimal answer. This can be implemented in 洧녝(洧녵2log洧녵) or even 洧녝(洧녵log洧녵).
