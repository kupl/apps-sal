This is the simple version of [Fastest Code : Equal to 24](http://www.codewars.com/kata/574e890e296e412a0400149c). 

## Task

A game I played when I was young: Draw 4 cards from playing cards, use ```+ - * / and ()``` to make the final results equal to 24.

You will coding in function ```equalTo24```. Function accept 4 parameters ```a b c d```(4 cards), value range is 1-13.

The result is a string such as ```"2*2*2*3"``` ,```(4+2)*(5-1)```; If it is not possible to calculate the 24, please return "It's not possible!"

All four cards are to be used, only use three or two cards are incorrect; Use a card twice or more is incorrect too.

You just need to return one correct solution, don't need to find out all the possibilities.
