In each trip, you will be asked to give the total sum of gold coins you have collected.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$. $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases is as follows.
- The next line of the input contains a single integer $N$. $N$ denotes the total number of Islands.
- The next line of the input contains $N$ space-separated integers $A1, A2, A3...An$ where $ith$ number denotes the maximum number of coins that the king of $ith$ island can donate.
- Next line contains a single integer $Q$. $Q$ denotes the total number of times traveler have to go for the trip.
- Next $Q$ lines contains, two space-separated integers $Q1,Q2$ denoting the start and end number of islands, i.e. traveler will start the trip from $Q1th$ island and will go till $Q2th$ island, in each trip.
Note: islands are numbered from $1$ to $N$.

-----Output:-----
- For each trip print the total number of gold coins, traveler will collect(each on a new line).

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq A1, A2, A3...An \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq Q1,Q2 \leq N$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
4
10 2 5 50
2
1 3
2 4

-----Sample Output:-----
17
57

-----Explanation:-----
- 
In 1st Trip, traveler will go from 1st Island to 3rd Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 10+2+5 = 17
- 
In 2 d Trip, traveler will go from 2nd Island to 4th Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 2+5+50 = 57
