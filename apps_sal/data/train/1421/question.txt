Patlu has recently got a new problem based on Pallindromes. A Pallindrome is a number that is same from front and back, example $121$ is pallindrome but $123$ is not . He wants to calculate sum of all $N$ digit number which are Pallindromic in nature and divisible by $9$ and does not contain any zero in their decimal representation. As the answer can be very large so print the sum modulo $10^9 + 7$.

-----Input:-----
- First line of input contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains single line of input , one integer $N$.

-----Output:-----
- For each testcase, output in a single line answer having $N$ digits pallindromic string.

-----Constraints-----
- $1\leq T \leq 100$
- $1\leq N \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----

-----Sample Output:-----
