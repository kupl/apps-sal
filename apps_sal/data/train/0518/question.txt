- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer as the number of ways.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
ways: [1,1,1], here chef climb to the next floor, one by one stair.
