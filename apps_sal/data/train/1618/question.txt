Create a function that differentiates a polynomial for a given value of `x`.

Your function will receive 2 arguments: a polynomial as a string, and a point to evaluate the equation as an integer.

## Assumptions:

* There will be a coefficient near each `x`, unless the coefficient equals `1` or `-1`.
* There will be an exponent near each `x`, unless the exponent equals `0` or `1`.
* All exponents will be greater or equal to zero

## Examples:

```python
differenatiate("12x+2", 3)      ==>   returns 12
differenatiate("x^2+3x+2", 3)   ==>   returns 9
```
