Motu and Patlu are racing against each other on a circular track of radius $R$. Initially they are at the same point on the track and will run in same direction .The coach ordered them to run $X$ rounds of the circular field. Patlu wants to know how many times they will meet after the race starts and  before any of them finishes $X$ rounds. But he is busy in warm up so he wants you to calculate this. You are given speed of both Motu and Patlu ($A$ and $B$). 

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers $X, R, A, B$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the number of times whey will meet before any of them completes $X$ rounds.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq R \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq X \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq A \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq B \leq 10^9$
- Speed of both are different

-----Sample Input:-----
