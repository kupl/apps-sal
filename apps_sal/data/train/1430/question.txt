Chef wants you to distribute candies among $N$ kids who are sitting in a circle. However, he wants to make some kids jealous of others. Thus, he wants you to distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids. 
Given the value of $N$ and $K$, you need to find the minimum number of candies you need to satisfy the given conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The only line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of candies you need.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq  10^6$
- $2 \leq  N \leq  10^3$
- $0 \leq  K \leq 10^4$ 

-----Sample Input:-----
1 
2 1

-----Sample Output:-----
3

-----EXPLANATION:-----
The minimum number of candies required is $3$. One kid needs to have $1$ candy and the other needs to have $2$ candy to have a difference of $1$ candy between them.
