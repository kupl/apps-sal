def odd_count(n):
    return n // 2
    '\n    Look at the top of the range: if it is odd then add 1, if even leave alone.\n\nLook at the bottom of the range: if it is odd then subtract 1, if even leave alone.\n\nTake the difference between the new even top and bottom; then divide by two.\n\nSo for the range [1,100] you get 100âˆ’02=50 odd integers.\n'
