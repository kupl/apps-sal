You are given Name of chef's friend and using chef's new method of calculating value of string , chef have to find the value of all the names. Since chef is busy , he asked you to do the work from him .
The method is a function $f(x)$ as follows - 
- 
$f(x)$ = $1$ , if $x$ is a consonent
- 
$f(x)$ = $0$ , if $x$ is a vowel 
Your task is to apply the above function on all the characters in the string $S$ and convert the obtained binary string in decimal number N. Since the number N can be very large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$ .
Input:
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each test line contains one String $S$ composed of lowercase English alphabet letters. 

-----Output:-----
For each case, print a single line containing one integer $N$ modulo  $10^9+7$ .

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 50$
- $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
codechef

-----Sample Output:-----
173

-----EXPLANATION:-----
The string "codechef" will be converted to 10101101 ,using the chef's method function . Which is equal to 173.
