# Testcase Example:  '[[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]'
#
# You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points
# on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
#
# The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan
# distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the
# absolute value of val.
#
# Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are
# connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
# Output: 20
# Explanation:
#
# We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
# Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
# Output: 18
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: points = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[-1,1]]
# Output: 4
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: points = [[-1000000,-1000000],[1000000,1000000]]
# Output: 4000000
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: points = [[0,0]]
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= points.length <= 1000
# -10^6 <= xi, yi <= 10^6
# All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
#
