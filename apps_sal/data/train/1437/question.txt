A prime number is number x which has only divisors as 1 and x itself.
Harsh is playing a game with his friends, where his friends give him a few numbers claiming that they are divisors of some number x but divisor 1 and the number x itself are not being given as divisors.
You need to help harsh find which number's divisors are given here.
His friends can also give him wrong set of divisors as a trick question for which no number exists.
Simply, We are given the divisors of a number x ( divisors except 1 and x itself ) , you have to print the number if only it is possible.
You have to answer t queries.
(USE LONG LONG TO PREVENT OVERFLOW)

-----Input:-----
- First line is T queires.
- Next are T queries.
- First line is N ( No of divisors except 1 and the number itself )
- Next line has N integers or basically the divisors.

-----Output:-----
Print the minimum possible x which has such divisors and print -1 if not possible.

-----Constraints-----
- 1<= T <= 30
- 1<= N <= 350
- 2<= Di <=10^6

-----Sample Input:-----
3
2
2 3
2
4 2
3
12 3 2

-----Sample Output:-----
6
8
-1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Query 1 : Divisors of 6 are ( 1,2,3,6) Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number 6 itself are ( 2 , 3). Thus, ans = 6.
Query 2 : Divisors of 8 are ( 1,2,4,8) Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number 8 itself are ( 2 , 4). Thus, ans = 8.
Query 3 : There is no such number x with only ( 1,2,3,12,x ) as the divisors.
