Ho, Ho, Ho!
It's Christmas time and our friendly grandpa Santa Claus is busy distributing gifts to all the nice children. With the rising population, Santa's workload every year gets increased and he seeks your help to wrap the gifts with fancy wrapping papers while he gets them distributed. 
Everything was going great until you realised that you'll fall short of wrapping paper. But luckily, you get a very innovative idea, that will allow you to pack all the remaining gifts without worrying about lack of wrapping paper. Any guesses what the idea is? Using ice for wrapping, obviously! That's the only thing available at the North Pole.
Now, in order to reduce your trips to the ice factory, you decide to write a program that helps you visualize how much ice is needed for a particular gift.
