I started this as a joke among friends, telling that converting numbers to other integer bases is for n00bs, while an actual coder at least converts numbers to more complex bases like [pi (or Ï€ or however you wish to spell it in your language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), so they dared me proving I was better.

And I did it in few hours, discovering that what I started as a joke actually has [some math ground and application (particularly the conversion to base pi, it seems)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-integer_representation).

That said, now I am daring you to do the same, that is to build a function so that it takes a **number** (any number, you are warned!) and optionally the **number of decimals** (default: 0) and a **base** (default: pi), returning the proper conversion **as a string**:

#Note
In Java there is no easy way with optional parameters so all three parameters will be given; the same in C# because, as of now, the used version is not known. 

```python
converter(13) #returns '103'
converter(13,3) #returns '103.010'
converter(-13,0,2) #returns '-1101'
```

I know most of the world uses a comma as a [decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark), but as English language and culture are *de facto* the Esperanto of us coders, we will stick to our common glorious traditions and uses, adopting the trivial dot (".") as decimal separator; if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.

Finally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.

That is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)
