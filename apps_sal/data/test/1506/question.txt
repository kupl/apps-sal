You are given an array a of length n. We define f_{a} the following way:

  Initially f_{a} = 0, M = 1;  for every 2 ≤ i ≤ n if a_{M} < a_{i} then we set f_{a} = f_{a} + a_{M} and then set M = i. 

Calculate the sum of f_{a} over all n! permutations of the array a modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note: two elements are considered different if their indices differ, so for every array a there are exactly n! permutations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤  1 000 000) — the size of array a.

Second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤  a_{i} ≤  10^9).


-----Output-----

Print the only integer, the sum of f_{a} over all n! permutations of the array a modulo 10^9 + 7.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
1 3

Output
1
Input
3
1 1 2

Output
4


-----Note-----

For the second example all the permutations are:

  p = [1, 2, 3] : f_{a} is equal to 1;  p = [1, 3, 2] : f_{a} is equal to 1;  p = [2, 1, 3] : f_{a} is equal to 1;  p = [2, 3, 1] : f_{a} is equal to 1;  p = [3, 1, 2] : f_{a} is equal to 0;  p = [3, 2, 1] : f_{a} is equal to 0. 

Where p is the array of the indices of initial array a. The sum of f_{a} is equal to 4.
