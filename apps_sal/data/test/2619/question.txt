The Cartesian coordinate system is set in the sky. There you can see n stars, the i-th has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}), a maximum brightness c, equal for all stars, and an initial brightness s_{i} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ c).

Over time the stars twinkle. At moment 0 the i-th star has brightness s_{i}. Let at moment t some star has brightness x. Then at moment (t + 1) this star will have brightness x + 1, if x + 1 ≤ c, and 0, otherwise.

You want to look at the sky q times. In the i-th time you will look at the moment t_{i} and you will see a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left corner has coordinates (x_1i, y_1i) and the upper right — (x_2i, y_2i). For each view, you want to know the total brightness of the stars lying in the viewed rectangle.

A star lies in a rectangle if it lies on its border or lies strictly inside it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, q, c (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10) — the number of the stars, the number of the views and the maximum brightness of the stars.

The next n lines contain the stars description. The i-th from these lines contains three integers x_{i}, y_{i}, s_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 100, 0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ c ≤ 10) — the coordinates of i-th star and its initial brightness.

The next q lines contain the views description. The i-th from these lines contains five integers t_{i}, x_1i, y_1i, x_2i, y_2i (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x_1i < x_2i ≤ 100, 1 ≤ y_1i < y_2i ≤ 100) — the moment of the i-th view and the coordinates of the viewed rectangle.


-----Output-----

For each view print the total brightness of the viewed stars.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the first example.

At the first view, you can see only the first star. At moment 2 its brightness is 3, so the answer is 3.

At the second view, you can see only the second star. At moment 0 its brightness is 0, so the answer is 0.

At the third view, you can see both stars. At moment 5 brightness of the first is 2, and brightness of the second is 1, so the answer is 3.
