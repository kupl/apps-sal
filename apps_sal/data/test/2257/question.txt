A flowerbed has many flowers and two fountains.

You can adjust the water pressure and set any values r_1(r_1 ≥ 0) and r_2(r_2 ≥ 0), giving the distances at which the water is spread from the first and second fountain respectively. You have to set such r_1 and r_2 that all the flowers are watered, that is, for each flower, the distance between the flower and the first fountain doesn't exceed r_1, or the distance to the second fountain doesn't exceed r_2. It's OK if some flowers are watered by both fountains.

You need to decrease the amount of water you need, that is set such r_1 and r_2 that all the flowers are watered and the r_1^2 + r_2^2 is minimum possible. Find this minimum value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integers n, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000,  - 10^7 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^7) — the number of flowers, the coordinates of the first and the second fountain.

Next follow n lines. The i-th of these lines contains integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 10^7 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 10^7) — the coordinates of the i-th flower.

It is guaranteed that all n + 2 points in the input are distinct.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum possible value r_1^2 + r_2^2. Note, that in this problem optimal answer is always integer.
