Eugeny loves listening to music. He has n songs in his play list. We know that song number i has the duration of t_{i} minutes. Eugeny listens to each song, perhaps more than once. He listens to song number i c_{i} times. Eugeny's play list is organized as follows: first song number 1 plays c_1 times, then song number 2 plays c_2 times, ..., in the end the song number n plays c_{n} times.

Eugeny took a piece of paper and wrote out m moments of time when he liked a song. Now for each such moment he wants to know the number of the song that played at that moment. The moment x means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the x-th minute of his listening to the play list.

Help Eugeny and calculate the required numbers of songs.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). The next n lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers c_{i}, t_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i}, t_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the description of the play list. It is guaranteed that the play list's total duration doesn't exceed 10^9 $(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{i} \cdot t_{i} \leq 10^{9})$.

The next line contains m positive integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{m}, that describe the moments Eugeny has written out. It is guaranteed that there isn't such moment of time v_{i}, when the music doesn't play any longer. It is guaranteed that v_{i} < v_{i} + 1 (i < m).

The moment of time v_{i} means that Eugeny wants to know which song was playing during the v_{i}-th munite from the start of listening to the playlist.


-----Output-----

Print m integers — the i-th number must equal the number of the song that was playing during the v_{i}-th minute after Eugeny started listening to the play list.
