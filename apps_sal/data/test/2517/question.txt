There are N towns in the State of Atcoder, connected by M bidirectional roads.
The i-th road connects Town A_i and B_i and has a length of C_i.
Joisino is visiting R towns in the state, r_1,r_2,..,r_R (not necessarily in this order).
She will fly to the first town she visits, and fly back from the last town she visits, but for the rest of the trip she will have to travel by road.
If she visits the towns in the order that minimizes the distance traveled by road, what will that distance be?

-----Constraints-----
 - 2≤N≤200
 - 1≤M≤N×(N-1)/2
 - 2≤R≤min(8,N) (min(8,N) is the smaller of 8 and N.)
 - r_i≠r_j (i≠j)
 - 1≤A_i,B_i≤N, A_i≠B_i
 - (A_i,B_i)≠(A_j,B_j),(A_i,B_i)≠(B_j,A_j) (i≠j)
 - 1≤C_i≤100000
 - Every town can be reached from every town by road.
 - All input values are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M R
r_1 ... r_R
A_1 B_1 C_1
:
A_M B_M C_M

-----Output-----
Print the distance traveled by road if Joisino visits the towns in the order that minimizes it.

-----Sample Input-----
3 3 3
1 2 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 4

-----Sample Output-----
2

For example, if she visits the towns in the order of 1, 2, 3, the distance traveled will be 2, which is the minimum possible.
