Valera has array a, consisting of n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} - 1, and function f(x), taking an integer from 0 to 2^{n} - 1 as its single argument. Value f(x) is calculated by formula $f(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} a_{i} \cdot b i t(i)$, where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.

For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3), then f(x) = a_0 + a_1 + a_3.

Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} - 1 (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4) — elements of array a.

The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s_0s_1... s_{n} - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} 2^{i} \cdot s_{i}$.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all $x \in [ 0 . . m ]$.

-----Note-----

In the first test case m = 2^0 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a_0 = 3.

In the second sample m = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a_0 + a_2 = 17 + 10 = 27.
