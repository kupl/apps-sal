Given are N points (x_i, y_i) in a two-dimensional plane.
Find the minimum radius of a circle such that all the points are inside or on it.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 50
 - 0 \leq x_i \leq 1000
 - 0 \leq y_i \leq 1000
 - The given N points are all different.
 - The values in input are all integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
x_1 y_1
:
x_N y_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum radius of a circle such that all the N points are inside or on it.
Your output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
2
0 0
1 0

-----Sample Output-----
0.500000000000000000

Both points are contained in the circle centered at (0.5,0) with a radius of 0.5.
