You are given n points on a line with their coordinates x_{i}. Find the point x so the sum of distances to the given points is minimal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of points on the line.

The second line contains n integers x_{i} ( - 10^9 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of the given n points.


-----Output-----

Print the only integer x — the position of the optimal point on the line. If there are several optimal points print the position of the leftmost one. It is guaranteed that the answer is always the integer.
