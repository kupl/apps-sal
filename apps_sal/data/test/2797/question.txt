One day you and GTmac walk into a classroom and see a mysterious expression on the blackboard:\[ (1^b + 2^b + \cdots + a^b)~ \mathrm{mod}~ a \]

Upon seeing the expression GTmac shows an evil smile and challenges you: “Let me give you the values of $a$ and $b$ and let’s assume $b$ is an odd number. Want to bet who can evaluate this expression? The one who loses shall buy pizza for us tonight.”

-----Input-----
The input has two integers $a$ ($1 \leq a \leq 10^9$) and $b$ ($1\leq b\leq 99$, $b$ is odd) on a single line.

-----Output-----
Output the value of the expression with the given $a$ and $b$.

-----Examples-----
