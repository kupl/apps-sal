Let's call left cyclic shift of some string $t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n$ as string $t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n t_1$.

Analogically, let's call right cyclic shift of string $t$ as string $t_n t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1}$.

Let's say string $t$ is good if its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.

You are given string $s$ which consists of digits 0–9.

What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $s$ to make it good?


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

Next $t$ lines contains test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains string $s$ ($2 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). Each character $s_i$ is digit 0–9.

It's guaranteed that the total length of strings doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the minimum number of characters you need to erase from $s$ to make it good.


-----Example-----
Input
3
95831
100120013
252525252525

Output
3
5
0



-----Note-----

In the first test case, you can erase any $3$ characters, for example, the $1$-st, the $3$-rd, and the $4$-th. You'll get string 51 and it is good.

In the second test case, we can erase all characters except 0: the remaining string is 0000 and it's good.

In the third test case, the given string $s$ is already good.
