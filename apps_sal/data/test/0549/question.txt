A big company decided to launch a new series of rectangular displays, and decided that the display must have exactly n pixels. 

Your task is to determine the size of the rectangular display — the number of lines (rows) of pixels a and the number of columns of pixels b, so that:

  there are exactly n pixels on the display;  the number of rows does not exceed the number of columns, it means a ≤ b;  the difference b - a is as small as possible. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of pixels display should have.


-----Output-----

Print two integers — the number of rows and columns on the display. 


-----Examples-----
Input
8

Output
2 4

Input
64

Output
8 8

Input
5

Output
1 5

Input
999999

Output
999 1001



-----Note-----

In the first example the minimum possible difference equals 2, so on the display should be 2 rows of 4 pixels.

In the second example the minimum possible difference equals 0, so on the display should be 8 rows of 8 pixels.

In the third example the minimum possible difference equals 4, so on the display should be 1 row of 5 pixels.
