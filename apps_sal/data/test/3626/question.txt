You are given a set of $n$ axis-aligned rectangles in a 2D plane. For this problem, two rectangles are considered to intersect if their boundaries contain any common points (in particular, two nesting rectangles donâ€™t count as intersecting). Determine if some pair of rectangles intersect.

In this example, only rectangles A and B intersect.

-----Input-----
Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($1\! \le \! n\! \le \! 10^5$), which is the number of rectangles.

Each of the next $n$ lines will contain four space-separated integers:$x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$

($-10^9\! \le \! x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2\! \le \! 10^9, x_1\! <\! x_2, y_1\! <\! y_2$), which describe a rectangle, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is the lower left corner and $(x_2,y_2)$ is the upper right corner. All $x$ values will be distinct. All $y$ values will be distinct.

-----Output-----
Output a single integer, which is $1$ if some pair of rectangles intersect, $0$ if no pair of rectangles intersect.
