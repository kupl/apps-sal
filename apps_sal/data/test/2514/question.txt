You have a sequence A composed of N positive integers: A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots, A_{N}.
You will now successively do the following Q operations:
 - In the i-th operation, you replace every element whose value is B_{i} with C_{i}.
For each i (1 \leq i \leq Q), find S_{i}: the sum of all elements in A just after the i-th operation.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 -  1 \leq N, Q, A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i} \leq 10^{5} 
 -  B_{i} \neq C_{i} 

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_{1} A_{2} \cdots A_{N}
Q
B_{1} C_{1}
B_{2} C_{2}
\vdots
B_{Q} C_{Q}

-----Output-----
Print Q integers S_{i} to Standard Output in the following format:
S_{1}
S_{2}
\vdots
S_{Q}

Note that S_{i} may not fit into a 32-bit integer.

-----Sample Input-----
4
1 2 3 4
3
1 2
3 4
2 4

-----Sample Output-----
11
12
16

Initially, the sequence A is 1,2,3,4.
After each operation, it becomes the following:
 - 2, 2, 3, 4
 - 2, 2, 4, 4
 - 4, 4, 4, 4
