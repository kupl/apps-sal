Mr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely edge i, has a color c_{i}, connecting vertex a_{i} and b_{i}.

Mr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following q queries.

In the i-th query, he gives you two integers — u_{i} and v_{i}.

Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex u_{i} and vertex v_{i} directly or indirectly.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains space-separated two integers — n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100), denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.

The next m lines contain space-separated three integers — a_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} < b_{i} ≤ n) and c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ m). Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if i ≠ j, (a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}) ≠ (a_{j}, b_{j}, c_{j}).

The next line contains a integer — q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100), denoting the number of the queries.

Then follows q lines, containing space-separated two integers — u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n). It is guaranteed that u_{i} ≠ v_{i}.


-----Output-----

For each query, print the answer in a separate line.

-----Note-----

Let's consider the first sample.  [Image]   The figure above shows the first sample.    Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2.  Vertex 3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3.  Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not connected by any single color.
