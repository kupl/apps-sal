Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function P(x) = a_0 + a_1x^1 + ... + a_{n}x^{n}. Numbers a_{i} are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer n is called a degree of a polynomial.

Vasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: "Determine how many polynomials P(x) exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that $P(t) = a$, and $P(P(t)) = b$, where $t, a$ and b are given positive integers"? 

Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.


-----Input-----

The input contains three integer positive numbers $t, a, b$ no greater than 10^18.


-----Output-----

If there is an infinite number of such polynomials, then print "inf" without quotes, otherwise print the reminder of an answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
