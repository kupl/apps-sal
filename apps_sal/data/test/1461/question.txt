You are given a functional graph. It is a directed graph, in which from each vertex goes exactly one arc. The vertices are numerated from 0 to n - 1.

Graph is given as the array f_0, f_1, ..., f_{n} - 1, where f_{i} — the number of vertex to which goes the only arc from the vertex i. Besides you are given array with weights of the arcs w_0, w_1, ..., w_{n} - 1, where w_{i} — the arc weight from i to f_{i}. [Image] The graph from the first sample test. 

Also you are given the integer k (the length of the path) and you need to find for each vertex two numbers s_{i} and m_{i}, where:  s_{i} — the sum of the weights of all arcs of the path with length equals to k which starts from the vertex i;  m_{i} — the minimal weight from all arcs on the path with length k which starts from the vertex i. 

The length of the path is the number of arcs on this path.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10). The second line contains the sequence f_0, f_1, ..., f_{n} - 1 (0 ≤ f_{i} < n) and the third — the sequence w_0, w_1, ..., w_{n} - 1 (0 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10^8).


-----Output-----

Print n lines, the pair of integers s_{i}, m_{i} in each line.
