You are given n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. You can perform at most k operations. For each operation you can multiply one of the numbers by x. We want to make [Image] as large as possible, where $1$ denotes the bitwise OR. 

Find the maximum possible value of [Image] after performing at most k operations optimally.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, 2 ≤ x ≤ 8).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

Output the maximum value of a bitwise OR of sequence elements after performing operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 1 2
1 1 1

Output
3

Input
4 2 3
1 2 4 8

Output
79



-----Note-----

For the first sample, any possible choice of doing one operation will result the same three numbers 1, 1, 2 so the result is $1|1|2 = 3$. 

For the second sample if we multiply 8 by 3 two times we'll get 72. In this case the numbers will become 1, 2, 4, 72 so the OR value will be 79 and is the largest possible result.
