Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n cards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been mixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at random and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a normal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards.

The trick itself is performed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the deck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles the deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the trick is successful.

You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he just pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the trick being successful if this is the case.


-----Input-----

First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks.


-----Output-----

On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10^{ - 6}.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2

Output
0.6666666666666666

Input
4 4

Output
0.4000000000000000

Input
1 2

Output
1.0000000000000000



-----Note-----

In the first sample, with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed.

With the remaining $\frac{2}{3}$ probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is $\frac{1}{2}$.

The resulting probability is $\frac{1}{3} \times 1 + \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3}$
