Recently Maxim has found an array of n integers, needed by no one. He immediately come up with idea of changing it: he invented positive integer x and decided to add or subtract it from arbitrary array elements. Formally, by applying single operation Maxim chooses integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and replaces the i-th element of array a_{i} either with a_{i} + x or with a_{i} - x. Please note that the operation may be applied more than once to the same position.

Maxim is a curious minimalis, thus he wants to know what is the minimum value that the product of all array elements (i.e. $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i}$) can reach, if Maxim would apply no more than k operations to it. Please help him in that.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of operations and the number invented by Maxim, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($|a_{i}|\leq 10^{9}$) — the elements of the array found by Maxim.


-----Output-----

Print n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} in the only line — the array elements after applying no more than k operations to the array. In particular, $a_{i} \equiv b_{i} \operatorname{mod} x$ should stay true for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, but the product of all array elements should be minimum possible.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
