You're given Q queries of the form (L, R). 

For each query you have to find the number of such x that L ≤ x ≤ R and there exist integer numbers a > 0, p > 1 such that x = a^{p}.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the number of queries Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5).

The next Q lines contains two integers L, R each (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Output Q lines — the answers to the queries.
