You're given an array $a$ of length $2n$. Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first $n$ elements isn't equal to the sum of the last $n$ elements?


-----Input-----

The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), where $2n$ is the number of elements in the array $a$.

The second line contains $2n$ space-separated integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_{2n}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$) — the elements of the array $a$.


-----Output-----

If there's no solution, print "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing $2n$ space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of $a$. You are allowed to not change the order.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 2 2 1 3 1

Output
2 1 3 1 1 2
Input
1
1 1

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first example, the first $n$ elements have sum $2+1+3=6$ while the last $n$ elements have sum $1+1+2=4$. The sums aren't equal.

In the second example, there's no solution.
