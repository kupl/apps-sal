The ABC number of a string T is the number of triples of integers (i, j, k) that satisfy all of the following conditions:
 - 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ |T| (|T| is the length of T.)
 - T_i = A (T_i is the i-th character of T from the beginning.)
 - T_j = B
 - T_k = C
For example, when T = ABCBC, there are three triples of integers (i, j, k) that satisfy the conditions: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 5), (1, 4, 5). Thus, the ABC number of T is 3.
You are given a string S. Each character of S is A, B, C or ?.
Let Q be the number of occurrences of ? in S. We can make 3^Q strings by replacing each occurrence of ? in S with A, B or C. Find the sum of the ABC numbers of all these strings.
This sum can be extremely large, so print the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

-----Constraints-----
 - 3 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
 - Each character of S is A, B, C or ?.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

-----Output-----
Print the sum of the ABC numbers of all the 3^Q strings, modulo 10^9 + 7.

-----Sample Input-----
A??C

-----Sample Output-----
8

In this case, Q = 2, and we can make 3^Q = 9 strings by by replacing each occurrence of ? with A, B or C. The ABC number of each of these strings is as follows:
 - AAAC: 0
 - AABC: 2
 - AACC: 0
 - ABAC: 1
 - ABBC: 2
 - ABCC: 2
 - ACAC: 0
 - ACBC: 1
 - ACCC: 0
The sum of these is 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 8, so we print 8 modulo 10^9 + 7, that is, 8.
