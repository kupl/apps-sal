Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer sequence $a_1, \ldots, a_n$. In order to not reveal the secret earlier than needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ using the following rules:

  $b_1 = a_1$;

 $b_i = a_i \oplus a_{i - 1}$ for all $i$ from 2 to $n$, where $x \oplus y$ is the bitwise XOR of $x$ and $y$. 

It is easy to see that the original sequence can be obtained using the rule $a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i$.

However, some time later Vitya discovered that the integers $b_i$ in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when decrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is not increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community, Vasya decided to find some permutation of integers $b_i$ so that the sequence $a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i$ is strictly increasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \leq b_i < 2^{60}$).


-----Output-----

If there are no valid permutations, print a single line containing "No".

Otherwise in the first line print the word "Yes", and in the second line print integers $b'_1, \ldots, b'_n$ — a valid permutation of integers $b_i$. The unordered multisets $\{b_1, \ldots, b_n\}$ and $\{b'_1, \ldots, b'_n\}$ should be equal, i. e. for each integer $x$ the number of occurrences of $x$ in the first multiset should be equal to the number of occurrences of $x$ in the second multiset. Apart from this, the sequence $a_i = b'_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b'_i$ should be strictly increasing.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 2 3

Output
No

Input
6
4 7 7 12 31 61

Output
Yes
4 12 7 31 7 61 



-----Note-----

In the first example no permutation is valid.

In the second example the given answer lead to the sequence $a_1 = 4$, $a_2 = 8$, $a_3 = 15$, $a_4 = 16$, $a_5 = 23$, $a_6 = 42$.
