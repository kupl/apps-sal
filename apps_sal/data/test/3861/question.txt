Given an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of n integers, find the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square.

A number x is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer y such that x = y^2.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^6 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that at least one element of the array is not a perfect square.


-----Output-----

Print the largest number in the array which is not a perfect square. It is guaranteed that an answer always exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
4 2

Output
2

Input
8
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 576

Output
32



-----Note-----

In the first sample case, 4 is a perfect square, so the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square is 2.
