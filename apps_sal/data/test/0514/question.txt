Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has $n$ days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for $d$ days to calculate the results.

Fortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends $x$ ($x$ is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in $\left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil$ days ($\left\lceil a \right\rceil$ is the ceiling function: $\left\lceil 2.4 \right\rceil = 3$, $\left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2$). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to $x + \left\lceil \frac{d}{x + 1} \right\rceil$.

Will Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than $n$ days?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 50$) — the number of test cases.

The next $T$ lines contain test cases – one per line. Each line contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$, $1 \le d \le 10^9$) — the number of days before the deadline and the number of days the program runs.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ answers — one per test case. For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if Adilbek can fit in $n$ days or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.


-----Example-----
Input
3
1 1
4 5
5 11

Output
YES
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first test case, Adilbek decides not to optimize the program at all, since $d \le n$.

In the second test case, Adilbek can spend $1$ day optimizing the program and it will run $\left\lceil \frac{5}{2} \right\rceil = 3$ days. In total, he will spend $4$ days and will fit in the limit.

In the third test case, it's impossible to fit in the limit. For example, if Adilbek will optimize the program $2$ days, it'll still work $\left\lceil \frac{11}{2+1} \right\rceil = 4$ days.
