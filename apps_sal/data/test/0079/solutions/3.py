Suppose there is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Thus, each trial has two potential outcomes called "success" and "failure". In each trial the probability of success is p and of failure is (1 âˆ’ p). We are observing this sequence until a predefined number r of failures has occurred. Then the random number of successes we have seen, X, will have the negative binomial (or Pascal) distribution:

{\displaystyle X\sim \operatorname {NB} (r,p)} {\displaystyle X\sim \operatorname {NB} (r,p)}
