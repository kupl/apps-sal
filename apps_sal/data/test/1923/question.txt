Snuke is having a barbeque party.
At the party, he will make N servings of Skewer Meal.
Example of a serving of Skewer Meal
He has a stock of 2N skewers, all of which will be used in Skewer Meal. The length of the i-th skewer is L_i.
Also, he has an infinite supply of ingredients.
To make a serving of Skewer Meal, he picks 2 skewers and threads ingredients onto those skewers.
Let the length of the shorter skewer be x, then the serving can hold the maximum of x ingredients.
What is the maximum total number of ingredients that his N servings of Skewer Meal can hold, if he uses the skewers optimally?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≦N≦100
 - 1≦L_i≦100
 - For each i, L_i is an integer.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
