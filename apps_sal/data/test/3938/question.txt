There is a square grid of size $n \times n$. Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $\min(h, w)$ to color a rectangle of size $h \times w$. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost.

The square is large, so we give it to you in a compressed way. The set of black cells is the union of $m$ rectangles.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$, $0 \le m \le 50$) — the size of the square grid and the number of black rectangles.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains 4 integers $x_{i1}$ $y_{i1}$ $x_{i2}$ $y_{i2}$ ($1 \le x_{i1} \le x_{i2} \le n$, $1 \le y_{i1} \le y_{i2} \le n$) — the coordinates of the bottom-left and the top-right corner cells of the $i$-th black rectangle.

The rectangles may intersect.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum total cost of painting the whole square in white.
