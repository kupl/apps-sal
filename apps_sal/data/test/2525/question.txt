Takahashi has a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
Starting with this string, he will produce a new one in the procedure given as follows.
The procedure consists of Q operations. In Operation i (1 \leq i \leq Q), an integer T_i is provided, which means the following:
 - If T_i = 1: reverse the string S.
 - If T_i = 2: An integer F_i and a lowercase English letter C_i are additionally provided.
 - If F_i = 1 : Add C_i to the beginning of the string S.
 - If F_i = 2 : Add C_i to the end of the string S.
Help Takahashi by finding the final string that results from the procedure.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5
 - S consists of lowercase English letters.
 - 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - T_i = 1 or 2.
 - F_i = 1 or 2, if provided.
 - C_i is a lowercase English letter, if provided.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
Q
Query_1
:
Query_Q

In the 3-rd through the (Q+2)-th lines, Query_i is one of the following:
1

which means T_i = 1, and:
2 F_i C_i

which means T_i = 2.

-----Output-----
Print the resulting string.

-----Sample Input-----
a
4
2 1 p
1
2 2 c
1

-----Sample Output-----
cpa

There will be Q = 4 operations. Initially, S is a.
 - Operation 1: Add p at the beginning of S. S becomes pa.
 - Operation 2: Reverse S. S becomes ap.
 - Operation 3: Add c at the end of S. S becomes apc.
 - Operation 4: Reverse S. S becomes cpa.
Thus, the resulting string is cpa.
