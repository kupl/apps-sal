Little C loves number «3» very much. He loves all things about it.

Now he has a positive integer $n$. He wants to split $n$ into $3$ positive integers $a,b,c$, such that $a+b+c=n$ and none of the $3$ integers is a multiple of $3$. Help him to find a solution.


-----Input-----

A single line containing one integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 10^9$) — the integer Little C has.


-----Output-----

Print $3$ positive integers $a,b,c$ in a single line, such that $a+b+c=n$ and none of them is a multiple of $3$.

It can be proved that there is at least one solution. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
