Takahashi has decided to work on K days of his choice from the N days starting with tomorrow.
You are given an integer C and a string S. Takahashi will choose his workdays as follows:
 - After working for a day, he will refrain from working on the subsequent C days.
 - If the i-th character of S is x, he will not work on Day i, where Day 1 is tomorrow, Day 2 is the day after tomorrow, and so on.
Find all days on which Takahashi is bound to work.

-----Constraints-----
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - 0 \leq C \leq N
 - The length of S is N.
 - Each character of S is o or x.
 - Takahashi can choose his workdays so that the conditions in Problem Statement are satisfied.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K C
S

-----Output-----

Takahashi is going to work on 3 days out of the 11 days. After working for a day, he will refrain from working on the subsequent 2 days.
There are four possible choices for his workdays: Day 1,6,10, Day 1,6,11, Day 2,6,10, and Day 2,6,11.
Thus, he is bound to work on Day 6.
