Today Pari and Arya are playing a game called Remainders.

Pari chooses two positive integer x and k, and tells Arya k but not x. Arya have to find the value $x \text{mod} k$. There are n ancient numbers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} and Pari has to tell Arya $x \operatorname{mod} c_{i}$ if Arya wants. Given k and the ancient values, tell us if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x or not. Formally, is it true that Arya can understand the value $x \text{mod} k$ for any positive integer x?

Note, that $x \text{mod} y$ means the remainder of x after dividing it by y.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,  k ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of ancient integers and value k that is chosen by Pari.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 1 000 000).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 5
2 3 5 12

Output
Yes

Input
2 7
2 3

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Arya can understand $x \operatorname{mod} 5$ because 5 is one of the ancient numbers.

In the second sample, Arya can't be sure what $x \text{mod} 7$ is. For example 1 and 7 have the same remainders after dividing by 2 and 3, but they differ in remainders after dividing by 7.
