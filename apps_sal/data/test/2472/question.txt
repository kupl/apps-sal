Kizahashi, who was appointed as the administrator of ABC at National Problem Workshop in the Kingdom of AtCoder, got too excited and took on too many jobs.
Let the current time be time 0. Kizahashi has N jobs numbered 1 to N.
It takes A_i units of time for Kizahashi to complete Job i. The deadline for Job i is time B_i, and he must complete the job before or at this time.
Kizahashi cannot work on two or more jobs simultaneously, but when he completes a job, he can start working on another immediately.
Can Kizahashi complete all the jobs in time? If he can, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9 (1 \leq i \leq N)

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1
.
.
.
A_N B_N

-----Output-----
If Kizahashi can complete all the jobs in time, print Yes; if he cannot, print No.

-----Sample Input-----
5
2 4
1 9
1 8
4 9
3 12

-----Sample Output-----
Yes

He can complete all the jobs in time by, for example, doing them in the following order:
 - Do Job 2 from time 0 to 1.
 - Do Job 1 from time 1 to 3.
 - Do Job 4 from time 3 to 7.
 - Do Job 3 from time 7 to 8.
 - Do Job 5 from time 8 to 11.
Note that it is fine to complete Job 3 exactly at the deadline, time 8.
