Fedya studies in a gymnasium. Fedya's maths hometask is to calculate the following expression:(1^{n} + 2^{n} + 3^{n} + 4^{n}) mod 5

for given value of n. Fedya managed to complete the task. Can you? Note that given number n can be extremely large (e.g. it can exceed any integer type of your programming language).


-----Input-----

The single line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^10^5). The number doesn't contain any leading zeroes.


-----Output-----

Print the value of the expression without leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
4

Output
4

Input
