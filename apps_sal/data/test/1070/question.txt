There are $n$ houses along the road where Anya lives, each one is painted in one of $k$ possible colors.

Anya likes walking along this road, but she doesn't like when two adjacent houses at the road have the same color. She wants to select a long segment of the road such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

Help Anya find the longest segment with this property.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ — the number of houses and the number of colors ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $1 \le k \le 100\,000$).

The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ — the colors of the houses along the road ($1 \le a_i \le k$).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of houses on the road segment having no two adjacent houses of the same color.


-----Example-----
Input
8 3
1 2 3 3 2 1 2 2

Output
4



-----Note-----

In the example, the longest segment without neighboring houses of the same color is from the house 4 to the house 7. The colors of the houses are $[3, 2, 1, 2]$ and its length is 4 houses.
