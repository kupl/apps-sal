Given $S$, a set of integers, find the largest $d$ such that $a + b + c = d$ where $a, b, c$ and $d$ are distinct elements of $S$.

-----Input-----
The input starts with an integer $1 \le N \le 4000$, the number of elements in $S$. It is followed by $N$ lines containing the elements of $s$, one per line. Each element of $S$ is a distinct integer between $-536870912$ and $+536870911$, inclusive.

-----Output-----
Output a single line containing the maximum $d$ as described in the statement. If no such $d$ exists, output a single line containing no solution.
