Given a sequence of integers a_1, ..., a_{n} and q queries x_1, ..., x_{q} on it. For each query x_{i} you have to count the number of pairs (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and gcd(a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r}) = x_{i}.

$\operatorname{gcd}(v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n})$ is a greatest common divisor of v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n}, that is equal to a largest positive integer that divides all v_{i}.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), denoting the length of the sequence. The next line contains n space separated integers a_1, ..., a_{n}, (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9).

The third line of the input contains integer q, (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 × 10^5), denoting the number of queries. Then follows q lines, each contain an integer x_{i}, (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

For each query print the result in a separate line.
