Takahashi and Aoki are going to together construct a sequence of integers.
First, Takahashi will provide a sequence of integers a, satisfying all of the following conditions:
 - The length of a is N.
 - Each element in a is an integer between 1 and K, inclusive.
 - a is a palindrome, that is, reversing the order of elements in a will result in the same sequence as the original.
Then, Aoki will perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times:
 - Move the first element in a to the end of a.
How many sequences a can be obtained after this procedure, modulo 10^9+7?

-----Constraints-----
 - 1≤N≤10^9
 - 1≤K≤10^9

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K

-----Output-----
Print the number of the sequences a that can be obtained after the procedure, modulo 10^9+7.

-----Sample Input-----
4 2

-----Sample Output-----
6

The following six sequences can be obtained:
 - (1, 1, 1, 1)
 - (1, 1, 2, 2)
 - (1, 2, 2, 1)
 - (2, 2, 1, 1)
 - (2, 1, 1, 2)
 - (2, 2, 2, 2)
