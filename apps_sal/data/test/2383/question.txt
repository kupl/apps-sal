We have N bricks arranged in a row from left to right.
The i-th brick from the left (1 \leq i \leq N) has an integer a_i written on it.
Among them, you can break at most N-1 bricks of your choice.
Let us say there are K bricks remaining. Snuke will be satisfied if, for each integer i (1 \leq i \leq K), the i-th of those brick from the left has the integer i written on it.
Find the minimum number of bricks you need to break to satisfy Snuke's desire. If his desire is unsatisfiable, print -1 instead.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 200000
 - 1 \leq a_i \leq N

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N

-----Output-----
Print the minimum number of bricks that need to be broken to satisfy Snuke's desire, or print -1 if his desire is unsatisfiable.

-----Sample Input-----
3
2 1 2

-----Sample Output-----
1

If we break the leftmost brick, the remaining bricks have integers 1 and 2 written on them from left to right, in which case Snuke will be satisfied.
