On a two-dimensional plane, there are m lines drawn parallel to the x axis, and n lines drawn parallel to the y axis.
Among the lines parallel to the x axis, the i-th from the bottom is represented by y = y_i.
Similarly, among the lines parallel to the y axis, the i-th from the left is represented by x = x_i.
For every rectangle that is formed by these lines, find its area, and print the total area modulo 10^9+7.
That is, for every quadruple (i,j,k,l) satisfying 1\leq i < j\leq n and 1\leq k < l\leq m, find the area of the rectangle formed by the lines x=x_i, x=x_j, y=y_k and y=y_l, and print the sum of these areas modulo 10^9+7.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq n,m \leq 10^5
 - -10^9 \leq x_1 < ... < x_n \leq 10^9
 - -10^9 \leq y_1 < ... < y_m \leq 10^9
 - x_i and y_i are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
n m
x_1 x_2 ... x_n
