You are given two strings $s$ and $t$, both consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

The substring $s[l..r]$ is the string which is obtained by taking characters $s_l, s_{l + 1}, \dots, s_r$ without changing the order.

Each of the occurrences of string $a$ in a string $b$ is a position $i$ ($1 \le i \le |b| - |a| + 1$) such that $b[i..i + |a| - 1] = a$ ($|a|$ is the length of string $a$).

You are asked $q$ queries: for the $i$-th query you are required to calculate the number of occurrences of string $t$ in a substring $s[l_i..r_i]$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers $n$, $m$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^3$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the length of string $s$, the length of string $t$ and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line is a string $s$ ($|s| = n$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

The third line is a string $t$ ($|t| = m$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integer numbers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the arguments for the $i$-th query.


-----Output-----

Print $q$ lines — the $i$-th line should contain the answer to the $i$-th query, that is the number of occurrences of string $t$ in a substring $s[l_i..r_i]$.
