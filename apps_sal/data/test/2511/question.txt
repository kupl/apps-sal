You are given a tree with N vertices and N-1 edges. The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge connects Vertex a_i and b_i.
You have coloring materials of K colors.
For each vertex in the tree, you will choose one of the K colors to paint it, so that the following condition is satisfied:
 - If the distance between two different vertices x and y is less than or equal to two, x and y have different colors.
How many ways are there to paint the tree? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.
What is tree?
A tree is a kind of graph. For detail, please see: Wikipedia "Tree (graph theory)"

What is distance?
The distance between two vertices x and y is the minimum number of edges one has to traverse to get from x to y.

-----Constraints-----
