You have m = n·k wooden staves. The i-th stave has length a_{i}. You have to assemble n barrels consisting of k staves each, you can use any k staves to construct a barrel. Each stave must belong to exactly one barrel.

Let volume v_{j} of barrel j be equal to the length of the minimal stave in it. [Image] 

You want to assemble exactly n barrels with the maximal total sum of volumes. But you have to make them equal enough, so a difference between volumes of any pair of the resulting barrels must not exceed l, i.e. |v_{x} - v_{y}| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.

Print maximal total sum of volumes of equal enough barrels or 0 if it's impossible to satisfy the condition above.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n·k ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ l ≤ 10^9).

The second line contains m = n·k space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — lengths of staves.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximal total sum of the volumes of barrels or 0 if it's impossible to construct exactly n barrels satisfying the condition |v_{x} - v_{y}| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.

-----Note-----

In the first example you can form the following barrels: [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 3].

In the second example you can form the following barrels: [10], [10].

In the third example you can form the following barrels: [2, 5].

In the fourth example difference between volumes of barrels in any partition is at least 2 so it is impossible to make barrels equal enough.
