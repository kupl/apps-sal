Bike is interested in permutations. A permutation of length n is an integer sequence such that each integer from 0 to (n - 1) appears exactly once in it. For example, [0, 2, 1] is a permutation of length 3 while both [0, 2, 2] and [1, 2, 3] is not.

A permutation triple of permutations of length n (a, b, c) is called a Lucky Permutation Triple if and only if $\forall i(1 \leq i \leq n), a_{i} + b_{i} \equiv c_{i} \operatorname{mod} n$. The sign a_{i} denotes the i-th element of permutation a. The modular equality described above denotes that the remainders after dividing a_{i} + b_{i} by n and dividing c_{i} by n are equal.

Now, he has an integer n and wants to find a Lucky Permutation Triple. Could you please help him?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).


-----Output-----

If no Lucky Permutation Triple of length n exists print -1.

Otherwise, you need to print three lines. Each line contains n space-seperated integers. The first line must contain permutation a, the second line — permutation b, the third — permutation c.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
1 4 3 2 0
1 0 2 4 3
2 4 0 1 3

Input
2

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In Sample 1, the permutation triple ([1, 4, 3, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2, 4, 3], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]) is Lucky Permutation Triple, as following holds:  $1 + 1 \equiv 2 \equiv 2 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $4 + 0 \equiv 4 \equiv 4 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $3 + 2 \equiv 0 \equiv 0 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $2 + 4 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $0 + 3 \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \operatorname{mod} 5$. 

In Sample 2, you can easily notice that no lucky permutation triple exists.
