Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are good.

Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. x_{i} < x_{i} + 1 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. gcd(x_{i}, x_{i} + 1) > 1 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1) (where gcd(p, q) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers p and q).  All elements of the sequence are good integers. 

Find the length of the longest good sequence.


-----Input-----

The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of good integers. The second line contains a single-space separated list of good integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5; a_{i} < a_{i} + 1).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the length of the longest good sequence.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
2 3 4 6 9

Output
4

Input
9
1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following sequences are examples of good sequences: [2; 4; 6; 9], [2; 4; 6], [3; 9], [6]. The length of the longest good sequence is 4.
