Alice and Bob begin their day with a quick game. They first choose a starting number X_0 ≥ 3 and try to reach one million by the process described below. 

Alice goes first and then they take alternating turns. In the i-th turn, the player whose turn it is selects a prime number smaller than the current number, and announces the smallest multiple of this prime number that is not smaller than the current number.

Formally, he or she selects a prime p < X_{i} - 1 and then finds the minimum X_{i} ≥ X_{i} - 1 such that p divides X_{i}. Note that if the selected prime p already divides X_{i} - 1, then the number does not change.

Eve has witnessed the state of the game after two turns. Given X_2, help her determine what is the smallest possible starting number X_0. Note that the players don't necessarily play optimally. You should consider all possible game evolutions.


-----Input-----

The input contains a single integer X_2 (4 ≤ X_2 ≤ 10^6). It is guaranteed that the integer X_2 is composite, that is, is not prime.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimum possible X_0.


-----Examples-----
Input
14

Output
6

Input
20

Output
15

Input
8192

Output
8191



-----Note-----

In the first test, the smallest possible starting number is X_0 = 6. One possible course of the game is as follows:   Alice picks prime 5 and announces X_1 = 10  Bob picks prime 7 and announces X_2 = 14. 

In the second case, let X_0 = 15.   Alice picks prime 2 and announces X_1 = 16  Bob picks prime 5 and announces X_2 = 20.
