There are n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} written in a row. For all i from 1 to n, values a_{i} are defined by the crows performing the following procedure:

  The crow sets a_{i} initially 0.  The crow then adds b_{i} to a_{i}, subtracts b_{i} + 1, adds the b_{i} + 2 number, and so on until the n'th number. Thus, a_{i} = b_{i} - b_{i} + 1 + b_{i} + 2 - b_{i} + 3.... 

Memory gives you the values a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, and he now wants you to find the initial numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} written in the row? Can you do it?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of integers written in the row.

The next line contains n, the i'th of which is a_{i} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the value of the i'th number.


-----Output-----

Print n integers corresponding to the sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. It's guaranteed that the answer is unique and fits in 32-bit integer type.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
6 -4 8 -2 3

Output
2 4 6 1 3 

Input
5
3 -2 -1 5 6

Output
1 -3 4 11 6 



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, the crows report the numbers 6, - 4, 8, - 2, and 3 when he starts at indices 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. It is easy to check that the sequence 2 4 6 1 3 satisfies the reports. For example, 6 = 2 - 4 + 6 - 1 + 3, and  - 4 = 4 - 6 + 1 - 3.

In the second sample test, the sequence 1,  - 3, 4, 11, 6 satisfies the reports. For example, 5 = 11 - 6 and 6 = 6.
