Let's consider a table consisting of n rows and n columns. The cell located at the intersection of i-th row and j-th column contains number i × j. The rows and columns are numbered starting from 1.

You are given a positive integer x. Your task is to count the number of cells in a table that contain number x.


-----Input-----

The single line contains numbers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the size of the table and the number that we are looking for in the table.


-----Output-----

Print a single number: the number of times x occurs in the table.


-----Examples-----
