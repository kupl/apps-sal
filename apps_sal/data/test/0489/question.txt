After returning from the army Makes received a gift — an array a consisting of n positive integer numbers. He hadn't been solving problems for a long time, so he became interested to answer a particular question: how many triples of indices (i,  j,  k) (i < j < k), such that a_{i}·a_{j}·a_{k} is minimum possible, are there in the array? Help him with it!


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a positive integer number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n positive integer numbers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of a given array.


-----Output-----

Print one number — the quantity of triples (i,  j,  k) such that i,  j and k are pairwise distinct and a_{i}·a_{j}·a_{k} is minimum possible.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
1 1 1 1

Output
4

Input
5
1 3 2 3 4

Output
2

Input
6
1 3 3 1 3 2

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Makes always chooses three ones out of four, and the number of ways to choose them is 4.

In the second example a triple of numbers (1, 2, 3) is chosen (numbers, not indices). Since there are two ways to choose an element 3, then the answer is 2.

In the third example a triple of numbers (1, 1, 2) is chosen, and there's only one way to choose indices.
