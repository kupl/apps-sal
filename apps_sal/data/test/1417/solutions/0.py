// First match is dist N, doesn't include anything
// aaa....aaa -> middle part can't all be decreasing

// First match is dist N, includes min-incr -> is unique, already counted

// First match is < N -> either came from min-incr or from subst
// You can distinguish because match..match includes everything smaller or everything smaller minus one of them
// Ending at min-incr gives unique thing

// How many distinct things end at subst?
// Ending at subst:   (b ijk ) lmn c xyz  ... c such that zyxbcnmlkji are sorted leftovers
                   or   b ijk lmn c xyz .... c
// Might as well not include xyz
+ sum_{i=1..n-1} n!/(i+1)! * (i+1)

// Simplified claim:
if it includes min-incr, then it's always unique;
if it includes subst, only count if it came from the end (j = 1) (in which case it always matches)
otherwise, it's just some delta-N match or it's all distinct
