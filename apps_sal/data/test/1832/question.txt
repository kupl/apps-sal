The length of the longest common prefix of two strings $s = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$ and $t = t_1 t_2 \ldots t_m$ is defined as the maximum integer $k$ ($0 \le k \le min(n,m)$) such that $s_1 s_2 \ldots s_k$ equals $t_1 t_2 \ldots t_k$.

Koa the Koala initially has $n+1$ strings $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{n+1}$.

For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) she calculated $a_i$ — the length of the longest common prefix of $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$.

Several days later Koa found these numbers, but she couldn't remember the strings.

So Koa would like to find some strings $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{n+1}$ which would have generated numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. Can you help her?

If there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints. 


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the list $a$.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 50$) — the elements of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$.


-----Output-----

For each test case:

Output $n+1$ lines. In the $i$-th line print string $s_i$ ($1 \le |s_i| \le 200$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Length of the longest common prefix of strings $s_i$ and $s_{i+1}$ has to be equal to $a_i$.

-----Note-----

In the $1$-st test case one of the possible answers is $s = [aeren, ari, arousal, around, ari]$.

Lengths of longest common prefixes are:  Between $\color{red}{a}eren$ and $\color{red}{a}ri$ $\rightarrow 1$  Between $\color{red}{ar}i$ and $\color{red}{ar}ousal$ $\rightarrow 2$  Between $\color{red}{arou}sal$ and $\color{red}{arou}nd$ $\rightarrow 4$  Between $\color{red}{ar}ound$ and $\color{red}{ar}i$ $\rightarrow 2$
